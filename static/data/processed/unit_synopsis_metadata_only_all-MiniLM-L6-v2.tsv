Indigenous Australian creative practice and ways of knowing	AHT2301	This unit offers you a synopsis of Indigenous Australian creative practice as a vehicle for the production of knowledge. This unit promotes an examination of Indigenous cultural productions from an Indigenous viewpoint and lens, which enables you to experience not only an acquisition of content of Indigenous practice but through a unique methodological Indigenous approach. You will examine historical and recent cultural productions to learn about their significance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait culture, society and its knowledge economy and its relationship to the broader Australian historical, cultural and political space. Lectures and tutorials provide you with necessary knowledge and a platform to engage with this knowledge in an appropriately ethnographical and experiential way. These lectures provide insight in to Indigenous production in context of pre-colonial history, an imagined post-colonial trajectory through to its interactivity with de-colonisation and the onset of new materialism. You will develop a deep understanding of the relationality that Indigenous culture has with the premise of Country, its impact on practice and its relationship to their own place and situated experience.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art
Photography: History and theory	AHT2440	"This unit will offer a history of photography from its invention in the mid-nineteenth century through to the present. It will also offer a survey of the various attempts to theorise the new medium of photography. The unit will conclude with a detailed consideration of the new ""digital"" era we are now living in, in which not only is ""photography"" the dominant artistic medium and technique but the whole world becomes in effect ""photographic"". Today it is arguable that ""photography' in the form of the digital not only determines the making of images but also their circulation and reception."	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art
Neo-Baroque aesthetics: History and theory	AHT2530	This unit focuses on Neo-Baroque aesthetics in contemporary culture and their historical antecedents. The Baroque themes of spectacle, trompe l'oeil excess, and incorporeal experience will be examined with reference to the visual arts from Caravaggio to Borromini. The return of these preoccupations in contemporary art and media will also be explored. Key historical and theoretical topics, such as the status of illusionism and narrative in art, the representation of spirituality, sexuality and death, and the recent 'remediation'of earlier visual forms and ideas will be emphasized.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art
Art criticism and curatorship	AHT2602	This unit explores the related practices of art criticism and curatorship and their role in communicating art to its publics. It offers a brief history of criticism/curatorship and critical/curatorial approaches, an assessment of reviews, including those of local exhibitions in Melbourne, and considerations of the theoretical underpinnings of critical reception. You are invited to explore how you might yourself participate in the production of visual critique in the form of exhibition reviews, catalogue essays, curatorial statements, artist statements and so forth.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art
Curating: Histories and theories	AHT2712	This unit will offer you an introduction to the most important and influential theories of curating and provide an overview of the history of curating from the mid-18th century on. Although the unit will focus on curating that involves art objects and art practices through a history of exhibitions, it will also consider historical and contemporary instances of curating that do not involve art objects (from the Wunderkammer to curating performance) or approach curating as an expanded field of practice that may be activist, temporal, decolonising, and so on. The overall aim of the unit is to provide you with a working vocabulary so that you can ask critical questions of the contemporary practice of curation. Lectures will largely provide a chronological history of curating, starting with early museums and collections, but with an emphasis on the rise of curating as a practice and the figure of the curator from the mid-1970s on. A number of key instances of curating (particular exhibitions and international biennales and triennials) will be selected for analysis. In this way, you will be given both an overall history of art curating and a way of thinking critically about the term's almost infinite expansion in the present. The unit aims to provide you with an appropriate working method for curating you might undertake in the future and a way of thinking about issues of curating if you choose to work in a museum or gallery context or write about art. In some ways, the unit is intended as complementary to the more practice-based unit Curating: Practices, although this is not its only possible outcome.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art
Curating: Practices	AHT2722	Curating: Practices is intended as a complement to Curating: Histories and theories in which students can begin to put their studies into practice and engage with key aspects of curatorial work.

The course will ask questions concerning the &quot;Australianness&quot; of Australian art and whether we can write a new history of Australian art appropriate to contemporary conditions.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art
The medium in contemporary art	AHT2801	This unit examines the medium and its materiality across a range of visual art practices including: painting, sculpture, installation, photography, video, multi-media, social practices and performance art. It focuses on a historical lineage of art's mediums and disciplines and how they are framed, constituted and judged in a diverse range of academic fields. Concepts and traditions of modern aesthetics, the effect of late-capitalism, socio-economic critiques of art and technology are pivotal to any understanding of how art's form moves between modes of medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary realms. The unit introduces key theoretical tenets to analyse late modernist and contemporary art practices as case studies. It introduces you to the critical dialogue around the medium and artists' material processes.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art
Contemporary Asian art and exhibitions	AHT2882	This unit introduces you to Asian contemporary art, with a focus on art after 1990. A flourishing art and museum scene in Asia, and heightened international interest, has helped propel Asian art into public visibility. In this context, there has been dramatic growth in Asian contemporary art practice, exhibitions, and museum collections, as well as new Asian art research and archiving initiatives. In this unit, you will explore histories of modern and contemporary art from Asian perspectives. You will become familiar with key contemporary artists and artworks that have come to define different national and regional art histories in Asia, as well as with pivotal writings, exhibitions, curators, and institutions that have helped shape these histories. You will learn to situate critically, modern and contemporary art within Asias artistic, cultural and political contexts, and become acquainted with influential scholarship and art writing from the region. Through guided learning projects, you will be encouraged to explore your own interests in Asia and Asian art. You will also be encouraged to think critically about Art Historys geographies, including against international developments of the contemporary and global art and exhibitions. You will relate Asian-Australian art histories to this, and tap into the wealth of Asian art collections and exhibitions in Australia as resources for learning.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art
Art writing and criticism	AHT3001	Art writing and criticism is a unit in the &quot;practical&quot; dimension of the study of art history. You will explore the various registers, genres and venues in which the discussion of art is carried out today - from academic journals, magazines, newspapers to online. You will both gain a theoretical perspective on these different approaches to the discussion of art and their various histories and yourself undertake a number of practical exercises in writing in these different styles and formats. You will especially be directed to thinking about what is the future of the discussion of art in the new age of the internet and the electronic media. What opportunities can they think of for yourself and others to put the art-historical knowledge you otherwise gain in your studies to practical use in the public arena? Throughout the unit a number of practical exercises in writing about art will be undertaken, giving you a sense of the different requirements for different kinds of writing. Above all, you will form the habit of writing about art, and understand that writing about art is a &quot;practice&quot; just as artists have a practice. To this extent, Art writing and criticism must be seen as allied to the units offered in art curation (Curating: Histories and Theories and Curating: Practices) in opening up to students studying Art History certain &quot;practical&quot; or &quot;vocational&quot; outcomes for your skills and knowledges.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Fine Art

Critical methodologies for action research	AMU2908	This unit engages with two key critical modes of inquiry: feminist and queer which are distinctive methodologies for Gender Studies and Sexuality Studies. These modes of inquiry underline the full cycle of a research process: from identifying a research topic, mapping research design, generating and analysing data to writing-up and disseminating research findings. Feminist and queer methodologies or theoretical frameworks underpinning research would critically consider aspects such as: identifying research gaps with a view to giving voice to the narratives of marginalised communities (e.g. gender and sexual minorities); grounding research in their lived realities and in specific social-cultural contexts; and practising reflexivity when faced with ethical dilemmas, engaging and representing the 'other' and interpreting, writing up and disseminating data.   In addressing the 'so what' criterion of research, a feminist and queer ethos also find full expression in taking action as a primary outcome of the research process hence action research (e.g. change mindsets, review policy, formulate framework for activism, etc.). The transformative ends of such research potentially realise feminist and queer praxis and in doing so, apply learning towards effecting social justice. The unit also aims to prepare students for the capstone experience - engaging with the workplace and community.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Malaysia School of Arts and Social Sciences

Stardom: Celebrity, society and power	AMU3127	Since the early 20th century film stars have been a central feature of cinema and have attained a prominent place within broader culture and society. They appear in magazines, on billboards, on television programmes, and now have a strong presence on the internet. The importance of stars stems from their economic function within cinema, their contributions to the meanings and affects of films, and their ideological role in defining and shaping popular conceptions of identity in societies at particular points in time. This course will offer a thorough interrogation of the star phenomenon, combining theoretical work derived from the field of 'star studies' with empirical analyses of specific films and stars. A host of extra-filmic materials, such as magazine articles, interviews, film reviews and promotional materials will also be analysed as students seek to identity the defining features of a number of star personas. Topics covered will include the history of stardom from the silent 'gods and goddesses' to modern day television stars and celebrity culture; the ideological role of stars in circulating and revealing dominant attitudes to class, gender, sexuality and race/ethnicity; and the cultural and national specificities of stardom through case studies of American, French, Indian and Southeast Asian stars. In doing so, there will be emphasis on the contribution stars make to the pleasures of cinema, while remaining attentive to the political implications of these hugely popular and highly influential representations of selfhood.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Malaysia School of Arts and Social Sciences

Contemporary feminisms in Asia	AMU3560	This unit as a whole explores what constitutes feminist knowledges and practices in Asia. As feminisms are historically 'western-centred', the unit considers the ways in which these resonate with lived realities in Asia. As such, feminist knowledges and practices of 'women of colour' (e.g. feminist-postcolonial thought) are privileged in this unit. Highly interdisciplinary in its concerns, the unit examines fluid and contextual characteristics of a 'who is a feminist'; how feminisms are practised vis--vis transformations in and through the body, dress (e.g. veiling) or fashion, gender-based violence and gender justice; what constitutes feminist knowledge (i.e. standpoint epistemologies) and who owns or produces such knowledge  (e.g. those who inhabit the margins such as queers, masculinities, diaspora, cyborgs, etc.). The unit aims to enable students to reflexively engage with the relevance of feminist theorising and practice by critically applying concepts and questions of identity, agency and feminist praxis to contemporary debates, issues or concerns. Feminisms have relevance when it potentially questions assumptions or biases even prejudices, reviews existing practices, particularly those that lead to gender-based discrimination and violence, opens-up possibilities for providing solutions to a particular problem or redress to a social injustice or spaces of negotiation to a controversy or impasse.   	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Malaysia School of Arts and Social Sciences
Southeast Asian cinema	AMU3565	What are the defining features of Southeast Asian cinema and what can they tell us about the culture, society and politics within the region?.

Drawing also on cases, developments, events and skills encountered in other International Studies subjects, a key aim of this unit is to consider whether it is possible to secure broader normative and humanitarian goals in a state-centric international system that still appears to take seriously the preservation of state sovereignty.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Malaysia School of Arts and Social Sciences
Performing Asian, African and black masculinities	AMU3574	The unit aims at assisting students towards an informed understanding of how masculinities are understood and enacted in Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, South Korea, Japan), Africa (Uganda, Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia), and in the United States. Scholars note that a more holistic approach to Gender Studies must take into serious consideration the meanings and relationalities between femininities and masculinities, particularly in the ways in which these synergies manifest diversely around the globe. Inspired by the insights of the celebrated masculinities scholar Raewyn Connell, this unit challenges flattened impressions of masculinity as universal, singular manifestations, and invites students to consider the unstable constructions of masculinities in relation to femininities and other intersecting issues. This eye-opening unit covers topics such as patriarchy and violence, military, spiritualities, non-heteronormative sexualities, disease, marriage, cooking, racism and female masculinities. Through a close examination of highly diverse and exciting resources, students will engage with and understand the complex and shifting performances of masculinities that impact men (and women) in Asia, Africa and the United States.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Malaysia School of Arts and Social Sciences

Deconstructing development	APG5628	What does 'development' mean as a body of ideas that structures systems of power, flows of resources, and social transformations across the globe? What does it mean in practice to intervene - often across diverse cultural contexts - with programmes designed according to these ideas of development? This unit addresses these questions by deconstructing the conceptual and practical pillars of development, and by interrogating similar concepts such as economic growth, progress, and modernisation. In addition to reviewing some early theorisations of development , the unit exposes the power-laden and unequal nature of contemporary development as an institutionalised set of practices that rose to prominence after World War II. Using case studies to paint a picture of geographically uneven development today, the unit explores whether development theories correlate with development-in-practice. It also explores the ways in which diverse social groups practice development alternatives, reclaiming development to forge more autonomous pathways to well-being. These alternative pathways raise questions about the normative side of development, and about whether the contemporary development institution should be deconstructed in practice.	postgraduate	Faculty of Arts	Human Geography

Natural hazards and human vulnerability	ATS1310	This unit takes as its starting point the catastrophes of our world today, such as droughts, earthquakes, epidemics, fires, floods, hurricanes, landslides, tsunamis and weather extremes, and seeks to provide a blended understanding between the mechanics and dynamics of these environmental phenomena with the social contexts in which these disasters occur. This subject analyses the wide range of environmental processes (hazards) that pose risks to human lives, livelihoods and settlements, and brings together physical and human geographical approaches to explore how risk in a chosen area is a function of both the hazards and the community's vulnerability. Local and international case studies form a central component of this unit. As well, questions pertaining to the role of international aid and risk management (including mitigation, protection and adaptation strategies) will be discussed.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Human Geography
Human rights theory 1	ATS1314	This unit is an introduction to the discipline of human rights. The central topic around which the unit is organised is the universality of human rights.

Linguistics and English language: Analysing communication	ATS1338	We spend an extraordinary amount of our time using language. In an average day, the number of words we come into contact with can be as high as 100,000. Small wonder linguistics, the scientific investigation of language, is such a fast growing and important field of study. In this unit, our focus is on the English language as a way to investigate languages from all over the world. We look at sounds (phonology), words (morphology) and meanings (semantics), and we explore the ways in which people from different social groups or historical periods use these features. Throughout the unit, we seek to answer fundamental questions to do with the unique human faculty of language  and we showcase the applications of this linguistic knowledge to real life	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Linguistic structure and language diversity	ATS1339	There are 7,000+ living languages in the world, each of which have their own structures, communities of users and cultures. In this unit we explore this diversity. Drawing on data from English and a range of other languages, we investigate the grammatical life of words  how they are built (morphology), how they are used to form larger units (syntax), and how this knowledge can be applied to experiences both inside and outside the education setting. As part of this, we explore issues around intercultural communication, multilingualism and multilingual societies, as well as areas such as language and globalisation and language endangerment. We also consider the role of cognitive and cultural constraints in shaping language forms and the processes by which languages develop and change.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics

Big ideas for better futures	ATS1366	It is said we live in a divided world faced with climate change, forced migration, economic upheaval, political polarisation, fake news, and an antibiotic apocalypse on the horizon. These challenges affect different groups unevenly, with dramatic consequences for some. The future is not certain, but can it be ours to shape? How does our imagined future shape the present? What can we learn from social change movements in the past? What kinds of futures do we want, can we imagine, or are even possible? How do we navigate the social world to take action that will make a difference? These are the sorts of questions that drive sociological inquiry. In this unit, we explore how societies in the past have engaged with major challenges, with a view to shedding light on the big ideas behind contemporary social movements in a diverse Australia.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Sociology

Environment, economy and society in world history	ATS2106	Human history is in large part a story of how societies dealt with the restrictions and advantages imposed upon them by their physical surroundings. Settlement patterns, diets, labor relations and transportation, for instance, all hinge upon what people had at their disposal and how they were able to manipulate those resources to meet new and changing needs. Facing nature also meant reflecting morally and intellectually upon why the world is the way it is, who or what made it that way, and what if at all is the role of (non)human animals, plants and other elements in it. Through case studies spanning the pre-modern and modern era, you will explore the ways that human social, religious and economic activities have interacted with the natural world, both shaping and responding to environmental change. Topics may include: agricultural and transportation technologies; urbanization and its footprint; scientific and industrial revolutions; the rise of capitalism; imperialism and indigenous economies; anthropogenic climate change.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History

Issues examined include: the material conditions that have impacted on women as writers and readers; the place of women in the literary canon; currents and tensions in feminist literary criticism and theory; recent debates regarding gender bias in the reception of women's writing; contemporary interventions to decolonise literary history; the impact of changing social norms regarding gender and sexuality. Themes examined include: love, sex, marriage, motherhood, race, class, work, power, suffering, violence, silence, friendship and freedom. Key questions include: Is there a distinctively feminine mode of writing? What kinds of freedoms and conditions does a women need in order to write?; and, Whose voices get noticed when writing by women is produced?	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Communications and cultures in the global era	ATS2250	The unit covers how people from different cultural backgrounds communicate or miscommunicate and how they can overcome any difficulties, resulting from cultural diversities. Today, intercultural interactions are part of everyday encounters in most work places. It is essential for future workforces to be equipped with knowledge and skills for cross-cultural communications. These are part of 'global competence' of the workforce. For effective learning outcomes, the unit employs interdisciplinary insights from communications, anthropology, cultural studies and psychology (e.g. E. Hall, W. Gudykunst). The unit also touches upon how ethnic groups utilise the media to express their identities, with reference to migrants in Australia, e.g. Chinese, Korean, Southeast Asian migrants.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Communications and Media Studies

Political psychology	ATS2256	This unit offers a broad overview of political psychology, and introduces a new perspective on how to understand the political world around us. The objectives of the unit are to first introduce students to key concepts from psychology that are relevant to politics (e.g., personality, social identity, the dynamics of social groups, the role of emotions, etc.), and second, to apply these concepts to various topics within political science, including leadership, race and inter-group relations, the formation of opinions and ideologies, political violence, media and political advertising, etc.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
"Long-form television: ""HBO"" and beyond"	ATS2257	The post-2000 era has seen radical transformations in the way television is produced, distributed, viewed and valued. This unit traces the development of one of the most visible and successful outcomes of these shifts, global long-form television series that experiment boldly with complex serial narratives, self-conscious stylistics and provocative themes and characters. Areas for discussion include the millennial industrial developments that enable these series to be produced, the critical discourses of 'quality' television that construct their artistic status, the transnational markets in which they circulate, and the audiences and fans that give them a cult life beyond the screen. Through examination of how these systems and strategies both break with and continue historical televisual traditions, the unit demonstrates how the long-form mode of storytelling exemplifies the cultural form of television as the most vital and influential of the millennial era.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Film and Screen Studies
The global rise of populism	ATS2258	Across the democratic world, populism has emerged as a powerful and destabilising force. This unit explores the origins, meaning and impact of populism in a range of national contexts. We will investigate the various forces driving the populist backlash, from anxieties about mass immigration to economic inequality and the urban/rural divide. Given the highly contested nature of populism, we will look in depth to different theories of populism, including institutional, ideological, discursive and socio-cultural understandings. Then we will apply these historical and theoretical understandings to regional case-studies, comparing and contrasting forms of populism in Australia, the United States and Europe.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Philosophical traditions	ATS2262	Contemporary philosophy encompasses several distinct traditions. This unit may cover some of the well-known traditions and figures in Western thought, such as Descartes and Cartesianism, Spinozism, or Kant; or it may cover topics and figures in the Indian, Continental, or early analytic philosophical traditions, such as Buddha, Sankara,�Nietzsche, or�Wittgenstein.�Recently, these important traditions and figures have begun to attract attention as sources for new approaches to contemporary issues.�This unit seeks to use these traditions to address fundamental questions across the discipline, such as: can we ever have certainty about anything? What is the self? What is the nature of the mind-body relationship?�Is enlightenment or liberation a coherent ideal? Can humans achieve liberation?�It may also cover the topics of sensuous experience and alienation, and theories of meaning and understanding.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy

The European Union from consensus to crisis	ATS2275	The European Union is a unique historic and political achievement. It helped turn Europe into a zone of peace and contributed to the consolidation of democracy in the post-fascist and communist eras. Yet it is also a polity in profound crisis. It is challenged from within by critics of its own democratic credentials in the wake of the Eurozone crisis and from without by security threats from a resurgent Russia and an influx of refugees. Students completing this unit in Prato will gain a deep understanding of the origins of today's European Union and the pathologies of its multiple crises. They will simulate policy paths out of the EU's 'wicked' problems and leave Prato equipped to respond to the global repercussions of the challenges facing the 'new Old World'.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Modern Italian political thought	ATS2276	The unit surveys Italian political thought & practice from the Renaissance to the New Millennium. It aims to give students a clear understanding of modern & contemporary Italian political ideas, culture and institutions. It begins by examining Italian political thinkers, diplomats, and activists' seminal contribution to Renaissance, Enlightenment and Modern political theories and movements. It then shows how Italian political thinkers shaped the competing ideologies at the heart of twentieth century Europe's crises & revolutions: Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism.  It will focus on one of Prato's most famous citizens, political theorist, diplomat, journalist, novelist and director Curzio Malaparte, whose life and work is a microcosm of these ideological disputes. It takes students to the present day by studying the rise and fall of Italy's First Republic (1948-1992) and its consensus democracy; the birth of the Second Republic (1992-), with its hopes for rebuilding Italian democratic institutions and civic culture in the context of endemic political corruption; and the recent emergence of Italian populist, anti-European Union movements.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Artefacts, objects and remains: Making sense of archaeological sites	ATS2277	Archaeologists understand archaeological sites by the artefacts they contain. The unit examines how archaeologists analyse collections of different kinds of artefacts excavated or collected from archaeological sites, and how histories of the past can be written from these finds. Such objects can include the spectacular, such as status objects and religious icons; and more mundane objects such as ancient food remains, stone artefacts and domestic pottery such as cooking wares. Students will work with real archaeological artefact assemblages and be shown how these can be made sense of as evidence of past cultural practices. They will compare archaeological artefacts with reference materials and systematically apply established methods of analysis developed internationally. These methods, and their implications for understanding the past, will be discussed through case studies drawn from current archaeological projects in the Australia-Pacific region. Students will be expected to attend a weekly 2 hour seminar that includes hands-on discussions of archaeological materials. A film of an archaeological excavation will be shown in one of those seminars, after which students will discuss how artefacts have enabled the archaeologists to work out that site's history.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Indigenous Studies Centre
Drugs, harm and crime	ATS2278	This unit introduces students to the implications of licit and illicit drug use on the individual and the broader society. It considers the regulation of drugs and drug laws and their application, with emphasis on legal, illegal and prescription drugs. Students will examine the history of drug use and drug regulation in Australia and internationally, which includes discussions around individual offenders to organised crime. Students will examine different responses to drugs such as decriminalisation, harm minimisation and more traditional punitive criminal justice approaches, as well as the US War on Drugs and its consequences. Students will study principal policies and implications of offences of possession, manufacture, self-administration, importation, prescription offences and supply. Students will analyse the ways in which the state and the criminal justice system responds to different types of drugs and drug offences, and why criminalisation of the production and consumption of drugs varies over space and time. Students will explore the challenges presented to society through drug use such as addiction, stigma and crime and contrast this with the challenges presented by legal drug use. The unit will also consider where drugs are grown or manufactured, and the challenges this raises for law enforcement and border control nationally and internationally. Finally, this unit will also introduce students to how illicit drug is researched, as well as the role of supranational structures such as the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Introduction to creative writing	ATS2279	The subject examines the tradition of modern creative writing and its applicability to contemporary writing practice from a comparative approach. The subject concentrates on a number of key texts from the Nineteenth to the Twenty-first century, and examines various key works which may be seen to exemplify, modify, or challenge these stylistic models. Students will be required to reflect both creatively and analytically on their own writing practice in the light of these texts. In the collaborative environment of workshops, students will be encouraged to experiment with a range of techniques, developing their drafting and editorial skills suitable to publication outcomes.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Video games: Industry and culture	ATS2280	Video games have become a major media industry, generating large revenues and exerting an ongoing impact on older media forms.

The archaeology of empires	ATS2283	Towards the beginning of the first millennium BCE the Assyrian state in upper Mesopotamia started to expand its borders. Many territorial states had done this before, but the military and economic ideology of conquest that motivated this expansion created a new kind of political entity -the empire- which was to set the stage for the political strategy of the next one thousand years. When the Assyrian empire finally collapsed, its territory was quickly taken by the Babylonians and Medes, who in turn were conquered by the Persian Empire, which, after 200 years of dominion over a territory stretching from the Mediterranean to the mountains of Afghanistan, itself fell to the army of Alexander the Great and his generals. In this unit we will examine how the material culture recovered by archaeology - from the palaces, battle accounts, and art of the elite to the houses, pottery, and ritual figurines of those they conquered - can tell us how these early empires extended their power to neighbouring communities and how these communities adapted to, and sometimes resisted, the encroaching empires that surrounded them. Cultures covered include Egypt, Ancient Judah-Israel, Assyria, Urartu, Babylon, Media, Persia and the Hellenistic empires.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures
The Roman Empire in the age of Augustus	ATS2288	The unit examines aspects of Roman political, social, and cultural history from the crucial period of transition from Republic to Empire (ca. 59 BCE to 69 CE). It focuses on a number of powerful individuals, especially Julius Caesar and the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynastyespecially Augustus, Claudius, and Neroas well as the court that grew up around themrivals, wives, freed slaves, bodyguards, and the sometimes resentful members of the Roman elite. We explore the life, literature, and material culture of the Roman Empire at its height. Key themes include the fall of the Roman Republic and the creation of an emperor in its place; the literature and material culture of imperial power and resistance; the rise to prominence of powerful groups like the Praetorian Guard, imperial freedmen, and provincial elites; and the realities of Roman rule in the provinces of the empire. To study imperial power and provincial identity, we explore the provinces of Britannia and Judea, examining the events and context of the bloody revolts against Roman power under Boudicca in Britannia and the Jewish-Roman War of 66 CE.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures

State sovereignty, human rights, and the responsibility to protect	ATS2330	Despite its recent inception, the doctrine of 'Responsibility to Protect' (RtP) is now a central part of international political efforts to prevent genocidal violence. RtP rejects a traditional view of absolute state sovereignty, and is instead based on the idea that states are only sovereign so long as they don't perpetrate or allow extreme human rights abuses. In this unit we begin by surveying the recent history of RtP as a guiding framework in international politics, and considering some of the challenges that have arisen around its implementation. We then investigate four sets of questions related to RtP, with both theoretical and practical aspects. First, is RtP a way for powerful nations to exert control over vulnerable nations? Second, are there reasons to doubt the effectiveness of RtP in achieving its aims? Third, what implications does the emergence of RtP have for how we understand the philosophical nature of human rights? Fourth, what are RtP's implications in relation to growing refugee crises in the 21st century?.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy

War and memory: Resistance, massacre and representation in second world war Italy	ATS2335	Through seminars, workshops and fieldwork this unit will examine how conflict has been represented, remembered and memorialised. The unit will have a specific focus on World War 2, the Italian Resistance, and the massacre of civilians in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. The unit will consider how written and visual responses to these events, material forms of remembrance - monuments, memorials, museums,  and cemeteries in, or within reach of Prato - each function to memorialise the dead and how in articulating political and national ideologies, such sites acknowledge and incorporate countervailing ideologies and the contradictory testimony of survivors. The unit will unpack, examine and critique the complex inter-relations between media, memory and war, exploring how in pursuit of specific political and cultural goals, memories of conflict are created, constructed and recovered through an array of artistic and memorial forms. Students will be invited to move beyond a purely theoretical understanding of these issues by visiting museums, massacre sites and their memorials, examining and critiquing their mediation and creating a critical/creative response to one such site.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	School of Languages, Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics
The Minotaur to the Trojan war: Aegean archaeology	ATS2337	In this unit we examine the art, architecture, burials and beliefs of two important pre-classical Aegean cultures, the Minoans of Crete and the Mycenaeans of mainland Greece. We study the labyrinthine palaces of the Minoans, the frescos and houses of the island culture of ancient Thera, and the rich burials and city states of Mycenaean Greece to discover what this material evidence reveals about social and economic organisation, ritual practice and thriving trade and exchange. Students are introduced to emerging techniques in archaeological research as we consider how these methods have influenced our interpretation of Minoan and Mycenaean culture. We explore the role of later Greek mythologies and epic poems, including Homer's Iliad, in shaping our interpretation of these Aegean societies and examine the reliability of their portrayal. Contemporary evidence from Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean is examined, to understand the wider world of the Minoans and Mycenaeans, alongside the study of the great city of Troy.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures
Asian imaginaries: Bollywood, Manga and other fictions in Asian worlds	ATS2341	The unit will explore and examine the images and ideas that circulate about Asia in the world. Students will gain appreciation of the conceptualisation of the 'idea' of Asia, not just as a geopolitical entity but, as a vital 'site' that is imagined and seen as generative of imagination. 'Asia' exists not only as a landmass between Europe and the Pacific, but also as an imaginary: imagined entity and identity. It is a relational idea that is created in opposition to Europe, and also in terms of neighbouring nation-states/regions within Asia. This unit will explore the fluidities of meaning and flows of culture within and outside Asia. It will prepare students to negotiate questions of Asian ethics and aesthetics, authenticity and identity, voice and representation, Otherisation and Asian Super-powerdom. Studying a diverse range of texts (fiction, films, and new media cultural forms), they will learn how to understand these powerful imaginaries in a comparative framework. They will build critical analytical skills in Asian studies that will help in understanding how Asia is created, determined and negotiated through active, ever-mobile cultures in the face of hegemonic discursive and representational practices. There will be a special focus on Australia's relationship with Asia.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	The Monash Intercultural Lab (MIL)
Study tour in Italy: Etruscan and Roman archaeology	ATS2344	This overseas study tour is an intensive introduction to the cultures of ancient Italy, focussing on the Etruscan and Roman civilizations. We will visit archaeological sites and view museum collections in Rome and Tuscany to familiarise ourselves with the material record of these ancient cultures and to investigate the presentation of the past. Students will examine Etruscan and Roman culture through lectures, discussions, site presentations, and first-hand experience with a wealth of physical materials, from monumental structures including the Colosseum and Pantheon, to the streets and shops of the port city of Ostia, preserved under Tiber mud for centuries; from fine sculptures and painted tombs to cooking pots and skeletons. Study will commence at the Clayton campus and then transfer to Italy, where we will explore the ancient sites of Rome and Etruria before moving to Prato, Tuscany, where seminars and field trips will familiarise students with core issues in studying and presenting the past.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures
The golden age of Athens	ATS2349	This unit focuses on the city-state of Athens during the 5th century BCE: the period when, in a burst of creativity, her citizens produced their greatest achievements. The unit offers a historical and archaeological framework within which to explore aspects of Greece in the 5th century: from the desperate battles of the Persian Wars to debates about democracy, philosophy, and history. We explore the literary and material culture of Athens at its height -the creation of the Parthenon, the works of Thucydides and Plato, and the evidence of an evolving political system- as well as the seeds of trouble planted within- slavery, unequal status for women and non-citizens, and an increasingly coercive empire. Students will identify ways in which the ideas and archaeology of Athens have shaped the modern world, from the practices of democracy to the Parthenon marbles debate and the development of the modern nation of Greece.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures
The archaeology of death in ancient Egypt	ATS2351	This unit charts the developments in Egyptian culture from 3050 BCE to 1650 BCE (the Old and Middle Kingdoms), using a wide range of material evidence and exploring modern theories to understand the processes involved. It focuses especially on how the ancient Egyptians engaged with death and how this helped shape their world view, including their expectations for the afterlife and the importance of preparing for this. We examine the phenomenon of the pyramids as the architectural manifestation of beliefs in the afterlife of the king, as well as the tombs of royal dependants and workers.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures
Interrogating racism: Indigenous Australians and the state	ATS2354	The unit focuses on theories of race and issues of ethnicity, prejudice and racism, with particular emphasis on the continuities and discontinuities of discourses on 'race' in Australia; language use in a multicultural context; the uses of opinion polls; the representation of Indigenous people in the media and other forms of popular culture; multiculturalism and Indigenous people. The value of an interdisciplinary approach to these topics is highlighted.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Indigenous Studies Centre
Race and power: Imagining Indigenous Australia	ATS2355	This unit critically examines the ability of white Australia to know Indigenous people through the discursive power of representation. This unit explores white Australia's attempt to represent Indigenous people, moving beyond the historical, political and legal 'facts' of the colonial encounter to address the inherent theoretical problems of 'talking' about and for Australia's Indigenous peoples. Topics covered include representation of Indigenous people in media, history, sport, culture, public administration and law. The unit is self reflexive and critically assesses way the Western academy has claimed to possess knowledge about Indigenous people and authority over Indigenous lives.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Indigenous Studies Centre
Contesting laws: Heritage, culture and land	ATS2358	When Europeans arrived in Australia they brought with them a complex system of laws which were markedly different to those used and practiced by Indigenous Australians for thousands of years. The subsequent imposition of European law over Indigenous law created significant tensions especially in relation to Indigenous connections to land, sea and culture. This unit undertakes an interdisciplinary study related to Indigenous Law, land rights, Native Title, Indigenous knowledge and cultural heritage. The unit critically examines some of the emerging and recent debates involving: Native Title and mining; intangible heritage (art-song-story); and general public responses to Indigenous land rights.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Indigenous Studies Centre
Hearing the country: Studies in Indigenous Australian ethnoecology	ATS2359	Australia is the site of a remarkable diversity of systems of knowledge. Indigenous knowledge systems and systems based on western scientific tradition have often been seen as the most distant poles on a continuum that ranges from myth to science. Continuing research in Australia shows that Indigenous ecological knowledge on this continent is detailed, localised and grounded in empirical observations. In addition, Indigenous knowledge is embedded within a system of ethics that is oriented toward long-term productivity. It is usual to contrast Indigenous knowledge with non-Indigenous systems of knowledge and care in order to show their divergence or even, in many instances, their oppositions.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Indigenous Studies Centre
Magic, science and religion	ATS2371	The unit enables students to gain understanding of what magic, ritual and spiritual beliefs means to people in the modern world. It also introduces first year students to some of the contributions that anthropologists and sociologists of magic and religion have made to knowledge of human societies. Case studies provide a comparative understanding of rituals and associated cosmologies in a variety of sociocultural settings, from both the developing world and post-industrial settings and examine critically the cultural borders established between the fields of science and spiritual belief. Topics include: magic's rationalities; teenage magic in the west; witchcraft in the non-west; materiality and faith; embodied experience and spirituality.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Anthropology
International development: Critiques and alternatives	ATS2378	The unit takes an anthropological approach to critiquing international aid and development and the global structures it is embedded within. Various theories of globalisation and the production of global inequalities will be explored. Anthropologists employ ethnographic research and methods to improve the understanding of development processes, and the notions of human progress it rests on. Through specific case studies of approaches, institutions, programs and practitioners across multiple cultural contexts an appreciation is built up of how development policy is imagined, produced, received or resisted and how those being developed, the so-called beneficiaries, are imagined, defined and assisted.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Anthropology
War and memory in the Asia Pacific: Legacies of World War II	ATS2382	This unit examines the legacies of World War II in the Asia Pacific region, especially Japan, Korea, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. It considers such well-known events as the Nanking Massacre of 1937 and the sexual slavery of so-called 'comfort women , as well as lesser known issues such as the use of Asian forced labour on the Burma-Thailand Railway or the experiences of colonial soldiers (Korean, Taiwanese, Filipino, Indian) in the conflict. Importantly, the unit examines critically how debates about the past affect international and domestic relations in the region, and why the wartime past continues to haunt Japan and its neighbours to this day.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Japanese Studies
Decolonisation: Past and present	ATS2394	Decolonisation--the process of attaining independence from foreign domination--is one of the central features of contemporary world history. It is understood to be both a political event and a socioeconomic and cultural process that can take generations to realise. This unit investigates the rise of modern decolonisation movements, the enduring legacies of colonialism, and the ongoing push for decolonisation in the contemporary world. Typically with a focus on Asia and Africa, this unit examines the period from the eighteenth century to the present	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Personality: Beyond the persona	ATS2400	This unit will introduce students to the development of personality theory from the late 19th century to the present time. It will examine a range of theories reflecting dominant paradigms and the ways in which they shaped contemporary thinking across a number of disciplinary areas including abnormal psychology, psychiatry, sociology and criminology. Each theory will be explored in relation to the historical, cultural and social context from which it emerged and the personal history of the originating theorist.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Narrative	ATS2410	The unit presents a survey of modes of narrative discourse in modern and contemporary literature. Through the close stylistic analysis of examples of short fiction, it provides an historical overview of key movements such as realism, naturalism, impressionism, and modernism, as well as postmodern and contemporary responses. Students will investigate the devices of narrative, including techniques of focalisation and point of view, story-telling, and the role of narrative in a range of cultural contexts. What constitutes narrative? What are its primary features? How does story-telling communicate meaning? How do we construct effective narrative texts? The texts studied are drawn from a wide variety of genres and countries.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Romanticism and reason in the long eighteenth century	ATS2422	This unit explores the revolution in thought that commenced in the eighteenth century and developed in the early nineteenth century, a movement that changed the course of literature. Texts both inform and are shaped by the debates of their age. New kinds of literature emerge. Innovative works embody and represent dialogues that were central to their historical contexts: dialogues between irrationality and reason, emotion and restraint, the familiar and the new, and Gothic and pastoral modes. In this unit students will study a range of innovative texts which connected literature with history, philosophy, and the visual arts. As modern readers, we can choose to encounter such texts aesthetically or as a means of gaining insight into the past. Depending on staff availability, this unit will primarily focus on either the rise of the Romantic aesthetic in literature, or on the concerns of the Romantic movement at its maturity	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
New media: From the telegraph to Twitter	ATS2436	This unit introduces students to the technological, social, economic and political forces driving the development, and adoption of new media and communications technologies. It examines case studies of when 'old technologies were new' such as the telegraph and radio as well as the social shaping of very recent examples of new media, such as Facebook, Sina Weibo, Qzone, Renren and Twitter. Instrumentalist, substantivist and technologically determinist perspectives on new media will be compared as a means of understanding the dynamic convergence of telecommunications, IT and media industries.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Communications and Media Studies
Youth media: Understanding media research	ATS2439	From blogging to radio-making, social media posting to TV watching, young people are media users who engage in a multitude of media practices as a means of communication, social interaction, activism or entertainment. While some of these practices are private and mundane, and some are public, deliberate and purposeful - they are all significant in revealing the critical role that media play in today's social life. This unit presents key concepts and research methodologies for studying youth media and their social impacts, covering topics such as celebrity cultures, media literacy, social justice. It draws on a range of international case studies to explore different experiences, meanings and uses of youth media as part of everyday contexts and a segment of media industries.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Communications and Media Studies
The public sphere	ATS2440	This unit introduces a key theoretical concept in the field of media and communications studies - the public sphere - and attends to key questions in media studies: what does media contribute to the realm of rational debate and how does this contribution facilitate public understanding of, and input to, policy and governance? In addressing these questions the subject raises important matters concerned with citizenship, the rise of political populism globally, individual response to public issues and the relationship between opinion and informed debate. It tracks the emergence of the theory of the public sphere, analyses the multiple uses and related applications of the concept, and explains how the public sphere relates to traditional and new communications and media environments.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Communications and Media Studies
On the road: Travel and representation	ATS2443	Cultural practices of travel and the ways these are represented in travel writing and related modes of communication form one of the most compelling fields of contemporary critical inquiry. This unit is designed to place this contemporary engagement within an historical, theoretical and practical perspective. It examines travel practices, attitudes and ideologies in a range of texts, including the popular travel book and the tourist guidebook, fiction, film and journalism. Its scope ranges from ancient pilgrimages through imaginary voyages, utopian fantasies, New World traveller's tales and the imperial quest, to the diverse branches of tourism today, including sex tourism and cyber travel.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Public relations strategy	ATS2455	In this unit, students learn to research, plan, write, and evaluate a public relations strategy. Students will develop and apply their understanding of strategic and socially responsible communication by working through contemporary case studies and authentic industry briefs and reflecting on the challenges of contemporary industry practice. They learn to develop critical and effective approaches to producing strategies based on sound research and analysis of issues and publics and understanding of organisational goals. In addition to learning about developing communication strategies in a dynamic media environment, students will develop their presentation skills and learn to write professional communication materials. Students will also engage with the ethical and legal dimensions of public relations activity to understand the impact on society.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Communications and Media Studies
Cybercrime	ATS2456	The unit provides a theoretical and empirical introduction to cybercrime. It begins by exploring how new technologies such as the internet facilitated old crimes and created new types of crime. This unit uses criminological and regulatory theories to explain how new crimes are created and old crimes are facilitated by new technologies. It also considers how cybercrime challenges existing laws and criminal procedures, and discusses issues related to the governance and prevention of crime in cyberspace. Topics include: the history of the internet; forms of cybercrime such as hacking, online fraud, identity theft, child pornography and cyber-bullying; Internet laws and regulations; policing and governance of cybercrime; and prevention measures.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Crime, media and culture	ATS2457	Crime, Media and Culture examines the representation of crime in the media and its relationship to wider understandings of, and reactions to, crime and criminal justice. This subject uses key critical criminological, sociological and media theories to interpret the representation of crime in the media. Key areas covered include representations of class, gender and race in relation to crime, the symbiotic relationship between journalists and key actors within the criminal justice system, the relationship between the media and policy formulation and the importance of fictional representations in reflecting, reinforcing and shaping popular understandings of criminal justice and criminality.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Policing	ATS2458	Drawing from both the classic and contemporary policing research, this unit considers key policing concepts and police behaviour found in democratic societies. The unit is divided in two parts. The first part broadly surveys police function and responsibilities, including the origins of policing, understanding jurisdictional differences among agencies, and overviews responses to contemporary crime and policing problems. The second part focuses on key sociological and social-psychological concepts that help to explain police officer behaviour. It focuses on the concepts of control, coercion and the use of force, how police organisational and operational cultures affect police-community interaction, and the delivery and effectiveness of police-led intervention.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Human rights in the criminal justice sphere	ATS2465	This intensively delivered unit is part of our Criminology in Prato programme. The unit introduces students to the study of human rights in the sphere of criminal justice and criminology. The unit will trace the impact of human rights across the differing phases of the achievement of justice in criminal justice systems. Focusing on a specific rights as case studies it will contrast national and international definitions of human rights in understanding responses to crime: including policing, court processes, prosecution and punishment.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Victims, justice and the law	ATS2469	The unit considers the concepts of justice, victims and the law as they exist within and beyond the legal system. The unit engages with historical and contemporary perspectives and constructions of these intersecting concepts to explore understandings of crime and criminality, and examine the potentials and limitations of the legal system in practice. Bringing together interdisciplinary approaches from law, criminology and socio-legal studies, this unit considers the relationships between law, justice and victims through the study of: criminal and civil law, restorative justice, therapeutic jurisprudence, public policy, the media, criminal justice procedures, human rights and social change.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Writing and editing for the workplace	ATS2490	This unit aims to further develop students' professional communication capabilities, to assist students to apply knowledge and skills from an academic context to workplaces. The primary focus of this unit is the development of an extended individual project focusing on analysis and development of writing and editing in a current organization. Further professional writing skills are developed through the documentation of the project (pitches and briefs, social media writing, bench-marking and final delivery reports, written and oral). As the expectations of communication in organisations and the modern world are rapidly evolving, the unit is also designed to further students' conceptual understanding of key issues in professional communication such as multi-modal-literacy, inter-cultural communication, digital writing and text creation. This knowledge will complement students' work in other media and professional communication studies insofar as it enables a consistent and thorough approach to media text construction.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Faculty of Arts
Reading the Past: Shakespeare and Renaissance literature	ATS2492	One of the main organizing principles of the Literatures in English major stream is periodisation, and the aim of this unit is to develop and extend students' historical understanding of modern English literature in its foundational period, in terms of its generic and aesthetic forms and structures and its ideological and political contexts and concerns, focussing on the work of such writers as William Shakespeare (1564-1616), John Donne (1572-1631), and John Milton (1608-1674). The unit will pay particular attention to the complex representation of gender and sexuality in the period. Shakespeare's plays will be considered in relation to the various interpretations which have been applied to or imposed upon them by critics and directors over the years, and how these reflect changing times and fashions as well as political and cultural biases.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Children's literature: A comparative study	ATS2519	"The unit introduces students to major developments in children's literature from the Victorian ""Golden Age"" to contemporary dystopian fiction. It examines canonical works by British, American, and Australian authors in a range of genres and forms, including the picture book. Specific issues examined include changing notions of childhood and the child figure, and the concept of the implied child/adolescent reader. Students will consider the ideological implications of the adult interests vested in the production of children's literature, and how the genre works to socialise children into dominant views about gender, race and class."	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Australian film and television: Local and global	ATS2529	This unit enables students to critically evaluate notions of nationalism in Australian Film and Television. Initially, the course will explore traditional theoretical constructions of nationalism before considering the contemporary reconfiguring of nationalism. This reconfiguring will be performed in relation to discourses such as policy arrangements in relation to political machinations, auteur constructions, traditions of landscape cinema, race relations, multiculturalism, beach culture, the social, globalism, marketing, distribution, gender and criticism. The unit will employ feature, documentary and short film and television examples as well as contemporary and archival audio-visual texts.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Film and Screen Studies
Film and television genres	ATS2530	From their beginnings, films and television series have endlessly repeated the same stories. This unit explores the concept of genre, remaking and adaptation in relation to a selection of contemporary and historical film and television texts. This unit describes genre as a complex situation that is enabled and limited by the related roles and practices of industry, critics and audiences. This understanding of genre is developed through three broad approaches to genre as: industrial category-deals with issues of production, including commerce and authorship; textual category, considers plots and structures; critical category, investigates issues of reception, audiences and institutions.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Film and Screen Studies
Screen storytelling: From classical narrative to multi-media world building	ATS2535	This unit analyses the many ways that stories can be told on screen. It aims is to explore how screen-based media utilise different narrative structures and models, as well as various aesthetic techniques to offer possibilities to creators and viewers to tap into the central human practice of storytelling. . The course draws examples from major innovatory phases in the history of film, television and other screen-based media. This includes the development of classical narrative model, Russian montage experiments in the 1920s, alternative formal systems in Asian film, Italian neo-realism, European art cinema, contemporary Hollywood, World cinema and multi-media storytelling focusing specifically on non-linear, multi-linear and interactive narrative forms. It introduces students to a range of theories developed to understand the organisation, techniques and impacts of narration in film, television and other platforms in order to enable students to make critical arguments and specific interpretations of screen texts.� �	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Film and Screen Studies
Film and television industries and technologies: key contexts	ATS2538	The meaning of a film or television series comes not just from what is represented on screen but from the contexts in which this representation takes place. This unit examines some of the key industrial and technological contexts that frame, support and mediate our understanding of film and television. These contexts, both official and public, include: industry publicity and marketing; advertising and commercial tie-ins; media coverage of stars and celebrities; censorship and studio self-regulation; and reviewing and criticism. Taking a longer, historical view the unit also considers the impact of cinematic and televisual technologies over time, such as: wide-screen formats in the fifties and sixties; home video and suburban multiplexes in the seventies and eighties; and the development and evolution of digital technologies, media franchising and streaming platforms through the nineties and into the present day.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Film and Screen Studies
Environmental policy and management	ATS2548	This unit provides an introduction to different perspectives and issues that influence environmental policy and management. It examines the rise of environmentalism as a broad based movement and how it has led to the framing of environmental problems by policy makers and managers in terms of state regulation, market-based, and citizen participation approaches. Themes include western ideas of property rights, neoliberalism and environmental governance, scientisation of environmental knowledge, Indigenous environmental management, internationalisation of environmental policy and corporate environmentalism.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Human Geography
Writing resistance: Understanding the power of Indigenous story-telling through literature	ATS2551	The unit will explore and examine the critical importance of Literature in developing an understanding of Indigenous story-telling and Indigeneity across the world. Students will gain an appreciation of the ways in which Indigenous literatures tell the stories of Indigenous peoples in their own voices and on their own terms, instead of being represented by mainstream narratives. You will learn how Indigenous literatures negotiate issues of aesthetics and ethics, authenticity and identity, voice and representation, individual authorship and community narrative. Studying a diverse range of prose (fiction and non-fiction) and poetry from across the world, including from Australia, Canada, India and the US, you will learn how to understand these powerful literatures in a comparative framework. You will build upon critical analytical skills in literary studies that will help in understanding how Indigenous sovereignty is determined through Literature in the face of hegemonic discursive and representational practices.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	The Monash Intercultural Lab (MIL)
Crime and justice policy	ATS2552	The unit prepares students to shape crime and justice policies in government agencies and non-governmental organisations by introducing them to the making and implementation of crime and criminal justice policies. It utilises contemporary case studies and engages policy makers and practitioners. Students are introduced to the dynamics of crime and justice policy-making in Victoria (state), Australia (federal), and internationally. The politics of crime and justice policy-making in Victoria are explored. The significant obstacles faced by policy makers, when attempting to develop effective and humane crime and justice policies, are addressed. Building on this foundational knowledge, students are given a practical introduction to the skills of policy development and writing. The focus of the unit then shifts from the making of crime and justice policy to its implementation, and students examine the various challenges associated with translating crime and justice policies into practice.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Indigenous justice in Australia	ATS2553	The unit introduces students to issues of Indigenous justice and injustice in Australia. This unit focuses on critically understanding the relationship between colonialism in Australia, Indigenous Law and systems of justice and contemporary concerns of injustice. By understanding the role of the criminal justice system in histories of Australian colonialism, students will learn how the criminal justice system has attempted to manage Aboriginal people from the European settlement into the present. Considering crime and criminal justice through a settler-colonial lens, students will learn from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices about experiences of crime and criminal justice, emerging trends in Indigenous justice and consider ways to improve and 'decolonise' current forms of criminal justice. Drawing upon Indigenous perspectives and critical inter-disciplinary work, students will examine topics such as: Indigenous customary law, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, mandatory sentencing practices, and the policing of public space, language in court systems and Koori courts.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology

Theorists examined include: Elizabeth Grosz, Luce Irigaray, and Iris Marion Young.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Sociology
Sex and the media	ATS2561	Sex and the media will examine contemporary media and the implications these have for gender, identity, relationships, communities and social policy. Critical interdisciplinary approaches are used to address the following key questions: How is sex, gender and sexuality created and produced by popular culture? How are cultural meanings around sex and gender made, circulated and reinforced? What roles do consumers have in determining and defining the product?	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Sociology
Witches and depravity in the medieval and early modern world	ATS2579	This unit will consider the cultural history of Western Europe from late antiquity through to the beginnings of modernity. We will focus particularly on the persecution of witches, accused sometimes of fornication with the devil or of infanticide and cannibalism, but will look also at other individuals and groups that have been considered sinful, unnatural, freakish or depraved. In so doing, we will explore the long story of the European outsider, and ask what these harsh designations and cruel treatments of people who were marginal or different might tell us about the history of European society as a whole.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Australia's black history	ATS2584	This unit will consider relations between Indigenous and non-Aboriginal people in Australia since 1770. The main topics will include the legal basis of British sovereignty; the nature of frontier contact; violence and the dispossession of Aboriginal people; Aboriginal depopulation; Aboriginal peoples' responses to colonialism; government policy and practice, from segregation to assimilation; and Aboriginal political movements.

Cultural diversity in contemporary Europe	ATS2619	The unit, presented over a four week period, involves a research-led case study of cultural diversity in Europe. Based at Monash University's Prato Centre, students will be introduced to the main overarching theories concerning migration and cultural diversity. Within these overarching theories, students will also encounter numerous concepts and perspectives including among others, cosmopolitanism, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, insider-outsider relations and the notion of 'othering'. Issues relating to race, culture, identity and citizenship will also be considered. The uniqueness of the unit and its relevance to the Prato setting is that students will use these theoretical underpinnings to frame a case study involving observational research to complete 3000 word case study concerning managing cultural diversity in Europe. Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting.

Mobile worlds: Borders, displacement and belonging	ATS2625	Why do politicians and citizens seem so threatened by refugees, asylum seekers and new migrants? Is it because these forms of human mobility challenge the traditional and outmoded nation-state system and the sense of social cohesion and security it has provided?. Or is it because of increasing anxiety, insecurity and inequality in a world changed forever by globalisation?. Mobile Worlds explores socially and culturally diverse forms of migrant experience, from among those known as gypsies, nomads, slaves, settlers, tourists, to refugees, asylum seekers and other displaced peoples, and the array of formal, informal and illegal migrants, guest workers, labour and love migrants, 'gold collar' workers and international students that move around the globe in ever increasing numbers. The subject seeks to explore the responses and interactions of diasporas, transnational and transilient networks and communities around the globe. The broader aim is to understand the diversity and implications of human movement, new border regimes and emerging trends that will characterise life in the future.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Anthropology

The unit combines the investigation of morpho-syntax with an enquiry into linguistic typology and universals. It introduces and evaluates different theoretical approaches to morpho-syntactic analysis.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Managing intercultural communication	ATS2671	The unit examines basic concepts of intercultural communication: face and politeness in language; the relation between cultural values and discourse; cultural variation in speech acts, turn taking rules and formulaic patterns; cultural differences in the organization of written and spoken discourse; and examines their interaction in intercultural communication in the global context. Case studies drawn from a wide variety of cultures will provide opportunities to examine language use in light of broader cultural, political and social issues such as stereotyping and discriminatory language, cultural expectation and attitudes, cultural awareness training, language reform and policies.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Exploring texts with computers	ATS2672	In the past, our human limitations constrained the possibilities of working with large bodies of text. But today, technology makes it easy to analyse millions, even billions, of words of text quickly and reliably. This unit introduces students to the basic methods used in analysing large text collections and looks at their application in fields such as literary studies, linguistics, history and translation. Students will learn practical techniques for analysing text collections, will use that knowledge to explore texts relevant to their disciplines and will reflect on the types of knowledge which can be gained using these methods and their value within contemporary humanistic scholarship.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Sociolinguistics	ATS2676	This unit explores the relationship between language and society. The unit focuses on language variation within and between societies, including how such variation may be linked to social, regional and ethnic factors, among others. Moreover, we show how variation is critically influenced by the values, attitudes and ideologies associated with language varieties and their speakers. Language variation will be examined in the context of speech communities and communities of practice. A particular focus will be the ways in which individuals exploit a range of linguistic resources to take stances in interaction and how speakers use these stances to (dis)affiliate themselves with communities.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Structure of English	ATS2681	The unit provides a step-by-step account of the basics of English grammatical structures from the perspective of the theoretical insights of modern linguistics. Such a knowledge has many practical applications, including foreign language learning and teaching, effective communication (especially written skills) and literary analysis. Using examples and exercises from 'real' language, this unit guides students through the practical analysis of the syntax of English sentences, comparing the patterns and structures of leading standard and non-standard varieties, especially those that have arisen as a result of the global spread of English.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Politics, violence and memory	ATS2691	There is a growing imperative for societies, particularly democratic societies, to deal with the violence of the past so that discordant groups can be reconciled and historical injustices repaired. This unit looks at the role of memory in politics and asks whether current attempts to 'deal with the past' are creating more compassionate democracies (i.e. democracies more attuned to the suffering of others) or making impossible demands upon the activity of politics itself.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Politics, media and elections	ATS2693	The media is one of the most important institutions in any political society. In a liberal democracy its role, political economy and the laws, which regulate it have profound implications for democracy, especially elections. In this unit, the politics of the media is studied with a particular emphasis on elections in established democracies, such as Australia, Britain and the United States. The unit explores the role that the media performs and also how it is used by political actors to shape democratic-electoral outcomes. The relationship between ever-evolving media technologies, political campaigning and voter behaviour is also investigated.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations

Encountering Empire	ATS2827	Empires were the standard form of global geo-political organisation up until the mid-twentieth century. In this unit you will explore how and why the tentative early encounters between medieval or early modern travellers and traders developed into the self-confident imperialisms of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. You will analyse the cross-cultural encounters between people, institutions and forms of knowledge that were at the heart of empires formation, expansion, consolidation, and collapse. You will examine the sites where imperial encounters took place � the ports, royal courts, plantations, households, markets, factories, army barracks, places of worship, schools and academies, parliaments, and print media where empires were built and contested, by ordinary people as well as elites, over centuries-long processes. You will also examine encounters at the sites of empires contested remembrance, in museums, courts of law, public spaces and discursive history wars.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History

Topics may include: pre-modern understandings of disease and the body; the history of the germ theory of disease; colonial medicine; eugenics; sexually transmitted diseases; alcoholism; cancer and the tobacco industry; and the opioid crisis.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Ethics	ATS2839	This unit examines major issues in ethical theory. One aspect of this is an inquiry into central questions in the philosophical sub-discipline known as 'metaethics'. Some of these questions include: are there objective moral facts? Is moral judgment grounded primarily in reasoning, or emotion, or something else? And what motivates people to do what they believe is right? The unit also involves an exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of consequentialist ethical theories, like Utilitarianism, which assess the morality of people's actions solely in terms of the consequences of those actions. The unit examines debates between these theories and rival theories that incorporate other elements, such as duties, rights, contractualist principles, and people's character and virtues.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Philosophy of mind	ATS2840	This unit is concerned with some philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness, in particular with the question whether consciousness is irreducibly non-physical. We shall look at all of the major theories of the mind/body relationship, and we shall also examine the prospects for the creation of artificial intelligence and conscious computers.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Screenwriting for media production	ATS2845	Successful screen-based media productions start with an engaging story that has been skilfully envisaged. In this unit students will draw upon practical theories of screenwriting to transform real-world research into industry standard scripts for both non-fiction and fiction productions. The unit will introduce basic strategies for concept development and demonstrate how to write supporting 'short docs' such as synopsis, outlines and treatments. Students will then apply stylistic conventions and narrative theories of screenwriting to transform these into shoot-ready scripts for non-fiction and fiction media productions. Students may wish to continue developing this work into finished video productions in ATS3983 Screen Project: From film theory to media production.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Film and Screen Studies
Youth, crime and justice	ATS2847	Young people are often seen as significantly contributing to the crime problem, with crime control policies often being directed specifically at them.� This module offers a critical perspective on the construction of youth crime and formal justice system responses to it.� Part One of the module will outline historical perspectives on youth crime and the age of criminal responsibility. It will critically examine the meanings and social construction of youth; the origins of understandings of youth as a social problem, the relationship between social exclusion and young peoples offending, and their experiences of victimisation.� The module will also assess theoretical explanations of youth involvement in crime and desistance.� Part Two of the module explores social responses to youth crime and the role of the formalised youth justice system. The various discourses which inform youth justice will be compared and the ways in which they have been applied in different jurisdictions will be critically and comparatively assessed. Finally, the module will consider the recent focus on early intervention, emerging arguments for minimum intervention and the potential for youth justice reform.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
God, freedom and evil	ATS2861	This unit addresses the question whether there are successful arguments for or against the existence of gods. The unit begins by considering what it would take for something to be a successful argument for or against the existence of gods. It then goes on to investigate a range of arguments for and against the existence of gods, and attempts to determine whether any of these arguments is successful.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Language, truth and power	ATS2865	This unit considers the way authority bearing practices are communicated and experienced. It also looks at the historical and conceptual difficulties involved in identifying and contesting false authority. The unit will focus primarily on Michel Foucault's writing on these topics. We will start with his treatment of language in The Archaeology of Knowledge, and move on to consider his conception of the relations between truth and power in Discipline and Punish and The History of Sexuality. We will also look at the critical reception and adaptation of Foucault's approach to these issues among contemporaneous commentators (e.g., Noam Chomsky) and more recent scholars (e.g., Beatrice Han-Pile). The unit may also consider the influence Foucault has had on feminist work on the history of philosophy (e.g., Michele Le Doeuff).	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Symbolic logic	ATS2866	Symbolic logic is a study of information and its representation in a range of forms. Because information and representation are so widespread, logic is a rich and rewarding field with strong connections to philosophy, mathematics, computer science, linguistics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. By pursuing their study at an abstract level, symbolic logicians produce results that can be applied to many of these disciplines simultaneously. Logic is particularly useful for teasing apart subtle differences between representations.This unit will introduce you to symbolic logic, and to some of the central tools in logical work: formal proof systems, models, consequence relations, and relations among these. We will consider different ways of doing logic, and think about strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Although our study will be primarily abstract, we will explore motivating examples from a range of different applications. No background in philosophy is required or assumed	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Anarchy, property, and the state	ATS2868	The unit will discuss the normative foundations of the state and of the institution of private property. What is the proper role of government? Why should we obey the law? What is the relation between property and liberty? When, if ever, is the government justified in redistributing property? These issues will be discussed mainly in the light of the work of classical thinkers, but some reference will also be made to contemporary political philosophers.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Environmental ethics	ATS2871	The current global environmental crisis poses both philosophical and urgent political challenges. This unit examines the implications of environmental concerns for our moral concepts and our current way of life. Should non-human animals have rights? What about species or ecosystems? What is the value of wilderness? How might our values, institutions, and way of life have to change in order for humanity and other species to have a future?	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Topics in Indian philosophy	ATS2872	The unit considers a range of topics in metaphysics and ethics from an Indian perspective. The aim is to contrast the views of the conservative Hindu philosophers with those of the Indian heretics. Among the metaphysical topics special emphasis is placed on the theories of the self and their relation to interesting Hindu doctrines of Karma and Rebirth. The course also explores the relations between karma and other enigmatic traditional Indian concepts.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
The moral psychology of evil	ATS2875	This unit investigates the nature of evil, in light of psychological and other factors that enable people to commit acts of great evil. Questions discussed include: If an evildoer suffered serious childhood abuse, should this influence our moral judgements of them? Does the role that situational factors often seem to play in explaining evildoing undermine the plausibility of character-based accounts of evildoing? Are we all capable of evildoing, if placed in certain circumstances? Can moral judgements be justifiably made of those with evil thoughts and desires that they never act on? How should we determine the appropriateness of medical treatment of evildoers? How do different accounts of evil bear on contemporary ethical theories? Current empirical research will also be used in addressing these questions.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Bioethics Centre
Audio Culture: The History of Electronic Music 	ATS2878	In this unit, students explore the history of electronic music, from early experiments with phonographs at the end of the nineteenth century to contemporary electronic dance music. Students investigate the important concepts and innovations that led to the development and adoption of tools for electronic music composition, recording and performance worldwide. We examine the influence, and eventual establishment, of electronic music genres within Western Art music, popular music, noise, improvisation, experimental music and jazz, and frame these within the political and philosophical climates of the cultures where they feature.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music
Writing about music: Headlines and hashtags	ATS2900	What is the role of the music writer? What prompts individuals to write about music? What skills does one require to become a successful music writer? This unit explores the rise of writing about music, and the many personalities who have long aspired to be the arbiters of taste, the keepers of standards and, in some instances, even the philosophers of their craft. Such writers have plied their trade in newspapers, journals, books, and, more recently, social media including Facebook and Twitter. By investigating key debates that have often sparked controversy and notoriety, the unit examines the role and function of music critics, broadcasters, journalists, philosophers, academics, magazine writers and bloggers, considering the agency that such individuals have exerted in the media past and present. In addition, students have the opportunity to develop key writing skills and produce work in print and digital forms.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music

By focussing on a range of themes and topics in countries such as China, Indonesia, Japan and Korea, this unit allows students to explore in depth topics relevant to their broad area of study, and encourages them to reflect on the nature of authority, the definition of justice, the interpretation of what is 'permitted' in Asian societies and the way in which these topics can and should be discussed in an academic context.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	School of Languages, Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics
Critical thinking: How to analyse arguments and improve your reasoning skills	ATS2946	"Critical thinking skills are useful in a wide variety of professions, including law, business, computer science, medicine, as well as in everyday life. What is the best way to construct, articulate and represent an argument? How do we distinguish real news from ""fake"" news? Should we believe what our doctors, mechanics, or financial advisors tell us, just because they are experts in their fields? By addressing questions like these, we will examine several methods of effective reasoning. We will also examine the ways in which reasoning can go wrong. Students who successfully complete the unit will be able to evaluate evidence, critique arguments, and use these abilities in a wide variety of situations, both in and beyond the classroom."	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Medieval Italy: Sites of encounter	ATS2957	This unit explores medieval Italy from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries as a site of encounter between a range of religious and cultural traditions: Islam, Judaism and both Latin and Greek Christianity, all sharing a common debt to classical antiquity. Taught in Prato, but involving travel to various locations in Italy. The unit provides an opportunity to understand the complex web of cultural interactions between Islam and Christianity in Sicily and southern Italy, as well as between Christians and Jews in Tuscany and other parts of northern Italy.

Blood and guts: A history of medicine in Europe	ATS2995	Held in London, the unit aims to introduce students to the history of medicine in Europe. Far from value-free, medical knowledge and practice is everywhere and always embedded in a social, political, economic, and cultural context. We will probe these entwined historical experiences through an analysis of the written texts, visual sources, and material artefacts left by patients and practitioners. The focus will be on the period from the eighteenth century through to the present, when technological innovation revolutionised medical care and life expectancy increased dramatically. Topics may include: patient experiences; medical professions and professionalisation; medical technologies and epistemologies; authoritative knowledge and power in the clinic and in the laboratory; medicine and colonialism; relationship between mind and body.� Great Britain is an optimal location for a deep dive into the history of medicine. A global hub of medical history, London offers many and varied venues for exploring this topic. More than two dozen specialised museums and libraries in and around the city highlight one or more aspect(s) of the history of medicine, while numerous other collections feature fine art and material culture relevant to its study. Thanks to its prominent role in medical innovations of the Enlightenment, Edinburgh offers its own unique story accessible through local museums and libraries. For students with an interest in public history or museum studies, this is an ideal opportunity to think critically about those fields.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Public relations and society	ATS2996	This unit explores the theory and practice of public relations through the lenses of society and culture. It draws on recent public relations scholarship to present diverse theoretical approaches to understanding public relations and its role in society. These socio-cultural approaches represent a shift away from the functionalist and normative understandings of public relations, which historically, and until recently, have dominated the field. Rather than viewing public relations as an organisational or management function, this unit explores public relations as a cultural activity influenced by social, political and cultural contexts, and actively involved in the construction of meaning. The unit is structured around three broad themes:1. Theories of public relations, introducing culture, globalisation and public relations history2. Cultures of public relations, introducing organisational culture, popular culture and social change3. Public relations in international and specific cultural contexts.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Communications and Media Studies

Producing and consuming Japan: A study tour through western Japan	ATS3309	This intensive study program enables students to recognise and assess the nature of consumption in Japan. Japan is famous internationally for its production of consumer goods. This unit addresses more specifically the diversity of scales of production, and examines the cultural discourses accompany and frame the marketing and consumption of consumer goods - both tangible as material objects and intangible as experiences, spaces or feelings. Students are encouraged to recognise and critically assess such discourses, and to use them to reflect on the diverse and multifaceted nature of contemporary Japanese society. With a starting point in Kyushu, the students spend a week with Kyushu University students developing individual research projects and taking level-appropriate language training. From there, groups travel via Hiroshima and small seaside communities to Osaka and Kyoto, experiencing these places as collections of contrasting neighbourhood and villages each with their own cultures of production and consumption. Students come out of their experience equipped with a more sophisticated understanding of Japanese society and culture, and the nature of production and consumption in a post-industrial, increasingly globalised world.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Japanese Studies
Writing in Australia	ATS3310	What is the relationship between writing and belonging? Do poems, short stories, novels and works of creative non-fiction produced in Australia affirm or challenge what we see as a uniquely Australian identity? This unit, with both Creative Writing and Literatures in English assessment options, is concerned with the contribution of literature to forming and interrogating the notions of identity, ideology, gender, ethnicity and sexuality in an Australian context. There will be an emphasis on contemporary writing, and the texts studies will include a range of literary genres. Through both critical and creative engagements, students will be invited to explore and, if interested, produce their own works of Australian writing.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Text and community in Medieval and Renaissance Italy	ATS3311	This intensive field work course of one week's duration is taught out of the Monash Prato Centre in mid-December in the year of offering, and utilises the intellectual capital of the members of the Prato Consortium for Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  The unit is centred on 'core skills' for Medieval and Renaissance Studies: archive, manuscript, palaeographical and interpretive skills. Students undertaking the course are introduced to archives and manuscripts, visual culture and urban landscapes. In particular, when possible this unit will draw on the resources of the Archivio di Stato of Prato, and the 'Archivio Datini Online' making maximal use of the digitized documents available through this portal. Texts will be read from a variety of historiographical perspectives, and considered within the appropriate historical contexts. Participants will generally have the opportunity to engage with some of the foremost scholars in this area of study. Students therefore will be expected to attend, and critique, workshops and lectures organized to coincide with their intensive week's study.

Held in the winter semester as a two-week intensive, students will spend a week in Johannesburg and a week in Rwanda exploring public debates on memory and justice through visits to memorial sites and museums. Places to be explored include Soweto, the Apartheid Museum, Constitution Hill, the Murambi genocide memorial, and a Gacaca village trial.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation
Cultural diversity in contemporary Europe	ATS3319	The unit, presented over a four week period, involves a research-led case study of cultural diversity in Europe. Based at Monash University's Prato Centre, students will be introduced to the main overarching theories concerning migration and cultural diversity. Within these overarching theories, students will also encounter numerous concepts and perspectives including among others, cosmopolitanism, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, insider-outsider relations and the notion of 'othering'. Issues relating to race, culture, identity and citizenship will also be considered. The uniqueness of the unit and its relevance to the Prato setting is that students will use these theoretical underpinnings to frame a case study involving observational research to complete 3000 word case study concerning managing cultural diversity in Europe. Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting. While the topic is a core focus and one of the research strengths in Sociology, it will appeal to students in a range of disciplines including those interested in international relations, law, criminology and Bachelor of Arts students in general.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Sociology
Australia-Pacific Youth Engagement: understanding the Australia-Pacific partnership	ATS3320	This unit will introduce you to the Pacific region, the Australia-Pacific partnership, and the important policies and strategies underpinning Australias broader regional engagement. Based around the strategic policies underpinning relations across the region, students will become familiar with the principles and priorities set by Pacific Island nations and see the complexity of some of the most pressing challenges first-hand. You will travel to one of three Pacific Island nations to undertake a deep-dive research project into one of the principles and underpinning priorities of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and the Framework for Pacific Regionalism, including sustainable development, economic growth, strengthened governance systems and security for all.

The archaeology of world rock art	ATS3328	A major way that archaeologists make sense of the past is through the images that people depicted on rocks and on cave walls: rock art is one of the most common, and most visually impressive kind of archaeological evidence. In this unit students will learn about the history of modern humans from 60,000-40,000 years ago into recent times across the world, through the symbols and artworks they made and used. They will learn about what cave art looks like across different regions of the world and from different periods of time, and the different kinds of theories and approaches that archaeologists have employed to try to make sense of this imagery. They will learn and be encouraged to reflect about how those theories concern not just 'other' cultures past and present, but also how they reflect on the preconceptions of the researchers themselves and their own cultures. Students will cover a range of topics from the earliest years of the discipline of archaeology to the latest writings on human symbolic behaviour, and from the Ice Age to more recent artworks.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Indigenous Studies Centre
State sovereignty, human rights, and the responsibility to protect	ATS3330	Despite its recent inception, the doctrine of 'Responsibility to Protect' (RtP) is now a central part of international political efforts to prevent genocidal violence. RtP rejects a traditional view of absolute state sovereignty, and is instead based on the idea that states are only sovereign so long as they don't perpetrate or allow extreme human rights abuses. In this unit we begin by surveying the recent history of RtP as a guiding framework in international politics, and considering some of the challenges that have arisen around its implementation. We then investigate four sets of questions related to RtP, with both theoretical and practical aspects. First, is RtP a way for powerful nations to exert control over vulnerable nations? Second, are there reasons to doubt the effectiveness of RtP in achieving its aims? Third, what implications does the emergence of RtP have for how we understand the philosophical nature of human rights? Fourth, what are RtP's implications in relation to growing refugee crises in the 21st century?.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy

International security studies	ATS3340	The unit introduces students to the key theories and issues facing global security today. It engages both traditional and non-traditional forms of security, examining global responses and options to address conflict, build peace, and create lasting security for states and individuals. The unit begins with an examination of the strengths and weaknesses of traditional approaches to security - looking at the development and evolution of the realist and liberal traditions.  It provides an analysis of these traditions' understanding of states and state behaviour, the use of power, the possibilities of state co-operation and the successes and failures of a rules-based order.  The unit continues with consideration of the opportunities and shortcomings of critical approaches to security - looking at the development of the so-called non-traditional approaches including constructivist, critical theory, feminist and post-colonial thinking on security.  These approaches offer different analyses of how we should understand and address current global challenges by giving greater consideration to the role of identity, culture, history, and individuals.  In looking at the different theoretical approaches, this unit will engage contemporary crises in global security such as conflict, humanitarian intervention, peace-building, inequality, environmental change, the role of states and global institutions, and human insecurity.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Study tour in Italy: Etruscan and Roman archaeology	ATS3344	This overseas study tour is an intensive introduction to the cultures of ancient Italy, focussing on the Etruscan and Roman civilizations. We will visit archaeological sites and view museum collections in Rome and Tuscany to familiarise ourselves with the material record of these ancient cultures and to investigate the presentation of the past. Students will examine Etruscan and Roman culture through lectures, discussions, site presentations, and first-hand experience with a wealth of physical materials, from monumental structures including the Colosseum and Pantheon, to the streets and shops of the port city of Ostia, preserved under Tiber mud for centuries; from fine sculptures and painted tombs to cooking pots and skeletons. Study will commence at the Clayton campus and then transfer to Italy, where we will explore the ancient sites of Rome and Etruria before moving to Prato, Tuscany, where seminars and field trips will familiarise students with core issues in studying and presenting the past.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures
From Alexander to Kleopatra: The rise and fall of the Hellenistic world	ATS3350	Alexander the Great expanded Macedonia from a small north Aegean kingdom to a huge territory stretching from the Danube to the Himalayas. After Alexander's death, that empire disintegrated into a series of warring kingdoms, initially ruled by Alexander's generals. Egypt, ruled by Ptolemy and his successors, became the centre of one of the most enduring of these Hellenistic kingdoms, lasting for nearly three centuries until the reign of Kleopatra VII, who struggled in vain to preserve her kingdom in the face of Roman expansion. This unit focuses on the world created by Alexander and the Ptolemies. Themes include the nature of Alexander's rule and that of the Ptolemies, the heterogeneous culture that developed as a result of Greco-Macedonian occupation, the problems faced by Kleopatra and her Ptolemaic predecessors with the growing threat of Roman power, the rivalry between and among ruling dynasties, and the ways in which the indigenous Egyptian culture flourished and adapted to the profound changes it experienced. This unit analyses archaeological, literary, and documentary sources to provide an interdisciplinary study of a time of unprecedented change in the ancient world.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures
Interrogating racism: Indigenous Australians and the state	ATS3354	The unit focuses on theories of race and issues of ethnicity, prejudice and racism, with particular emphasis on the continuities and discontinuities of discourses on 'race' in Australia; language use in a multicultural context; the uses of opinion polls; the representation of Indigenous people in the media and other forms of popular culture; multiculturalism and Indigenous people. The value of an interdisciplinary approach to these topics is highlighted.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Indigenous Studies Centre
Hearing the country: Studies in Indigenous Australian ethnoecology	ATS3359	Australia is the site of a remarkable diversity of systems of knowledge. Indigenous knowledge systems and systems based on western scientific tradition have often been seen as the most distant poles on a continuum that ranges from myth to science. Continuing research in Australia shows that Indigenous ecological knowledge on this continent is detailed, localised and grounded in empirical observations. In addition, Indigenous knowledge is embedded within a system of ethics that is oriented toward long-term productivity. It is usual to contrast Indigenous knowledge with non-Indigenous systems of knowledge and care in order to show their divergence or even, in many instances, their oppositions.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Indigenous Studies Centre
Anthropology of human rights	ATS3376	The unit introduces students to cross-cultural notions of human rights. Anthropology places human rights in broader analyses of power, politics and social inequality. Political leaders in various countries dismiss human rights as a Western concept that cannot be universalised. At the same time, tensions exist between anthropological notions of cultural plurality and relativism and the universalism inherent in dominant human rights discourse. Yet critical representatives of the discipline argue that anthropologists are ethically bound to defend human rights. This unit will explore the debates within anthropology over human rights. It will explore related notions of conflict, structural violence, peace, law and human rights activism with ethnographic examples from a range of geographic and sociocultural settings. In doing so, this unit will introduce students to key concepts and debates in the anthropology of human rights and provide fresh, rich understandings of local-global frictions and the operation of power.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Anthropology
A world of sport: Business, politics and media	ATS3391	This unit examines Australian sport within a global context.

Decolonisation: Past and present	ATS3394	Decolonisation--the process of attaining independence from foreign domination--is one of the central features of contemporary world history. It is understood to be both a political event and a socioeconomic and cultural process that can take generations to realise. This unit investigates the rise of modern decolonisation movements, the enduring legacies of colonialism, and the ongoing push for decolonisation in the contemporary world. Typically with a focus on Asia and Africa, this unit examines the period from the eighteenth century to the present.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
The politics of identity	ATS3399	In the 21st century our identities, and our relationships to others, are constructed out of a multitude of interactions - some based in 'real' world institutions such as work and school, others are online and continued at a distant. Our experience of our 'identity' in these contexts can be both destructive and empowering. This Unit will explore political, social and cultural approaches to understanding the politics of identity in the 21st century, the consequences that relationships have for our sense of identity, and how we can understand the variety of human actions that are shaped by these relationships.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Psychoanalytic readings - Freud, Jung, Lacan	ATS3407	Introduction to the theories of Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan and Carl Gustav Jung, based on a close reading of seminal texts. Key concepts of Freud's, Jung's and Lacan's psychoanalysis in their historical intellectual context: the unconscious and the structure of the psyche, sexual theory, the interpretation of dreams, the critique of civilization and religion. Exploration of the application of psychoanalysis in literature, the arts and social psychology. The logic and limits of psychoanalytic interpretation.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	School of Languages, Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics
Aesthetics and European philosophy	ATS3419	The word 'Aesthetic' comes from a Greek verb which means 'to sense'. This unit will explore the ways sensation relates to meaningful experiences of general significance. We will investigate questions such as the essence of the art work, the structure of perception, the notion of beauty, and the historical-cultural constitution of experiences. We will do this via studies of the aesthetic thought of major continental European philosophers of the last two centuries. Major figures covered may include Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze, Foucault, Lyotard, Kristeva, Rancire and Badiou.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Literature and modernism	ATS3421	Does language create our world, or does it merely describe it? If it is the former, then what are the stakes for literature? Working with a range of novelists, poets, and theorists, this course will explore literature that engages with these questions of representation in the most innovative and exciting ways. Modernism has long been a term used to describe a radical international and experimental movement in the arts dating roughly form 1890 to 1940. More recently, however, modernism has undergone a reassessment and is now increasingly seen as an ongoing aesthetic response to various social, moral, technological, and political transformations. This unit will examine some of the major figures of avant-garde and 'High' modernism but it will also be attentive to examples of regional, 'middlebrow' and popular modernist literature's, as well as to modernism's afterlife in postmodern and contemporary literature. We will reflect on some of the most influential concepts in the early part of the twentieth century in relation to cultural and material upheavals, including urbanization, scientific and technological advances, conflicts about sexuality, and the women's movement. Our focus will be on the literary works from both within and outside of the English-speaking world that stand at the heart of definitions and debates about modernism. Foreign-language texts will be studied in English translation.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Communications ethics, policy and law	ATS3445	Privacy laws, anti-vilification legislation, classification codes and whistleblowing protection are major issues in contemporary media and policy debates. This unit will explore the ideal of freedom of expression, and the principles governments use to limit this freedom. The first part of the unit covers the reasons why we think freedom of expression is important, and the strength of the arguments used to justify it. The second part of the unit applies these ideas to contemporary moral and political debates, such as whistleblowing and leaking, privacy and defamation, hate speech, pornography, computer games, classification laws, and anti-terrorism legislation.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Communications and Media Studies
International crime and justice	ATS3462	The unit is focused on global crime and justice. It draws on scholarship in criminology and other relevant disciplines, engaging students in current critical debates on how crime and criminal justice responses to it operate in a national and global context. The unit employs an eclectic mix of theoretical perspectives to understand the extent and nature of global crime and the mechanisms used to control it.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Study tour: Comparative criminology USA	ATS3464	This intensively delivered unit is part of our Criminology Overseas program. The unit introduces students to the comparative study of criminology which involves the study of crime and social control across different cultural contexts. While it may appear easy to make simple comparisons, there is a need for a far greater understanding of what, how and why a comparison is being made. This unit studies the production of criminological knowledge across cultures as well as its meaning and how we understand it. This unit it gives students the opportunity to gain on-location access to experienced professional practitioners - Judges, Police/FBI, Prison staff - in the field of criminology in the United States of America. Examples of topics for comparative understanding include: prisons and punishment, policing, social inequality and crime, immigration and race/ethnicity, organised crime/gangs, and juvenile justice.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Human rights in the criminal justice sphere	ATS3465	This intensively delivered unit is part of our Criminology in Prato programme.

Focusing on a specific rights as case studies it will contrast national and international definitions of human rights in understanding responses to crime: including policing, court processes, prosecution and punishment.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Sex, gender and crime	ATS3466	This unit examines the intersection of sex and crime, and the role gender stereotypes play in the operation of the criminal justice system. Key critical criminological, feminist, masculinities and queer theories are used to explore how social norms of femininity and masculinity produce particular sexed understandings of crime and criminality. Theoretical insights and contemporary understandings of the criminal justice system, popular and media representations, and development of public policy responding to sex and crime are surveyed, and critical assessments made. Topics include sex and the nature of crime; gender and policing; femininity, masculinity and violence; and, sexed and sexual violence.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Fairy-tale traditions	ATS3496	The unit focuses upon the historical development of literary fairy tales for both adults and children from the seventeenth century to contemporary adaptations across media forms. Students will learn theoretical approaches through which to examine the retelling of fairy tales in both oral and literary tradition and how to situate variants within their historical context. In addition, students will explore the cultural and ideological significance of shifting perceptions of the genre as suitable for child readers. Key issues studied will be cultural production, gender and historicism.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Advanced poetry writing	ATS3509	The subject examines contemporary poetry and poetics and its applicability to writing practice through a comparative approach.

Gender and sexuality in film and television	ATS3531	Gender and Sexuality in Film and Television surveys different dimensions of film feminism. It acknowledges the vital ways in which feminist film theory has shaped the discipline and the importance of gender and sexuality in understanding how film and television circulates amongst diverse audiences. Topics may include genre, authorship, women in industry and activism. The unit will critically engage with debates in film studies and also draw on concepts in gender, LGBT, nonbinary and critical race theory. There will be an emphasis on theories of spectatorship, audiences and the relationship between film and television and the viewer. A range of different contemporary and historical screen examples will be discussed and viewed throughout the semester, encompassing film and television from Australian, the USA, Asia and other regional or national contexts.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Film and Screen Studies
Alternatives in film and television	ATS3536	Alternatives in film and television raises questions of aesthetics and politics to consider a varied body of work, one considered 'alternative' in relation to 'dominant' cultural practice and value. The unit takes a range of case studies to understand how film and television texts set themselves apart dominant forms and practices at certain historical moments and in diverse national contexts. For example the unit might examine the new American cinema of the sixties and European counter-cinema of the seventies, or post-punk and American indie films of the 1980s and beyond. In the same way, the unit may take as its case study the work of women or Indigenous, or political filmmakers worldwide.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Film and Screen Studies

Environmental assessment and decision making	ATS3546	This unit deals with the processes for assessing the potential environmental consequences of a range of human activities with a focus on development proposals and land use changes. These can be highly contentious because of the conflicting interests, types of knowledge and values of different stakeholders. The unit will examine the nature of the widely-adopted procedure of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), exploring relevant legislative frameworks and understandings of best practice. It will also examine� related processes�of social impact assessment, health impact assessment, risk assessment and strategic environmental assessment. Students are encouraged to critically evaluate existing processes and argue for improvements to deliver more sustainable and socially equitable outcomes.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Human Geography
Resource evaluation and management	ATS3554	Management of environment and natural resources involves deep human-environment interactions. Looking beyond the science of soils, minerals, water and plants, this unit reveals the human factors that shape the need for and access to natural resources. Framed through a social-ecological lens, the unit examines different management practices and evaluation approaches that shape resource decision-making (and resource conflicts) in Australia and beyond. By exploring social, political, economic, and institutional settings of critical natural resources (e.g. water, forests, minerals, soil/land), we uncover drivers of natural resource conflicts (e.g. rainforest destruction, land degradation, pressure on water supplies) and discuss pathways towards more sustainable resource management approaches. �	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Human Geography

It introduces a range of theoretical frameworks and approaches to the study of nationalism, with reference to appropriate case studies, to build students understanding of nationality, nation building, ethnicity and conflict. Students will be expected to engage with the political, social and cultural histories of a number of nations in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex issues related to the formation and maintenance of nation states and national identities throughout the modern era.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Global disasters: Catastrophe and social change	ATS3626	This unit examines the social history and impact of disasters from the late nineteenth century to recent times. Case studies include environmental and industrial disasters, pandemics, famines, and climate change events. We examine the processes that make disasters 'global', like travel and communications technologies and environmental systems. Using films, photographs, media reports and autobiographical sources, we examine the representation and experience of disasters to learn how they have been understood, experienced and responded to in contested ways. In doing so, we analyse the social causes of 'natural' and 'unnatural' disasters; how catastrophes have been catalysts for social change; and how disasters stimulate utopian and dystopian ideas about the globe's future.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Global cultures, media flows: Creating and consuming (popular) culture	ATS3627	The consumption (and re-creation) of rap in Japan, animated film in Kuala Lumpur and curry laksa in Melbourne are just a few of the examples of transnational cultural flows which are visible the world over. The mass electronic media of cinema, television, and the Internet have sped up the transnational flow of images of modernity and created local desires to consume cultures originating in distant places. This unit looks at the implications of globalisation for a variety of cultural phenomena, tracing transitions from local to global cultural practices. It looks at specific cases of local consumption of global cultures, including television, video games, popular music, fiction and comics, and the Internet.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Japanese Studies
Post-conflict: Justice, memory, reconciliation	ATS3632	This unit examines the emergent histories of post-genocide and post-conflict societies.

It recognizes the different experiences of women, children and men in conflict and their different paths to reconciliation. Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia, South Africa, post-Holocaust German-Jewish relations, Germany's reunification, and Australia will be discussed, along with processes such as reparations, international criminal tribunals and truth commissions.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation
Indigenous peoples globally	ATS3634	The unit introduces students to basic issues connected with indigeneity such as the first peoples concept; historical engagements with colonial or settler populations; the importance of distinctiveness to indigenous identities; and the importance and vulnerability of heritage in indigenous groups.  The unit extends these understandings by exploring the emergence of indigeneity as a global political movement. It examines the emergence of a global political discourse of indigeneity, as well as the implications of this emergence for domestic political regimes. By referring to African, Australian, Asian and American examples, it explores how indigenous groups have secured better outcomes by advocating for their causes in global institutions and networks in which an indigenous rights framework has taken shape. It explores the media forms and celebrity advocacy (such as the project of the rock star Sting in the Amazon) that made indigeneity a global concept; the problems occurring when indigeneity is valued as a political resource by groups; and the stress accompanying indigenous discourses which appear to replicate primordial movements.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Anthropology
Poverty, climate change and international justice	ATS3639	What does justice demand of rich individuals and/or nations in response to poverty, climate change and natural disasters? What difference does it make if these misfortunes occur inside or outside of our national border? What is the proper role of international organizations in addressing these problems? This unit examines conflicting answers to these questions offered by leading theorists in environmental ethics and international justice. The unit will serve as an introduction to central moral and political dilemmas of the 21st century. No background in philosophy is required, merely an interest in rational debate about world affairs and a passion for the question: what ought we to do?	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Journalism and global change	ATS3645	This unit explores the significance of people power to journalism and role of journalism in empowering the dispossessed. Students gain critical insight into key forms of reporting that raise issues of advocacy, agency and accountability, including environmental journalism, peace and development reporting, and public journalism. By exploring the rationale behind each, students learn to approach news not as a series of discrete violent events but rather as part of complex, ongoing processes of social and environmental change. Drawing on case studies, theory and practical research techniques, students will evaluate gate-keeping decisions while producing in-depth investigations of their own.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Journalism
Japanese language in action	ATS3649	The unit complements Japanese language learning by investigating everyday language use from a variety of analytical perspectives. Examining examples from a range of sources and contexts, students will explore how Japanese is structured, used, and affected by cognitive, social and cultural factors. Observation and analysis of actual language use will contribute to advancing language proficiency and understanding of Japanese language and culture. Language use will be examined through different lenses which may include: applied linguistics, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, interactional linguistics, corpus analysis, second language acquisition and sociolinguistics. Students will conduct small research projects employing different methods to examine and understand how language is used in daily interactions.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Japanese Studies

History and sociolinguistics of English	ATS3673	This unit will survey the history of English (origins, development, diversification, recent convergence, etc.; including the origins and development of the key features which distinguish the main varieties of the language), and the relevant basic aspects of theoretical historical linguistics and philology. It will also deal with the main sociolinguistic facts and issues associated with the statuses and functions of the English language as it exists today and of the key varieties of English in the various societies in which they are used.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Meaning and the mind	ATS3674	This unit considers the uniquely human ability: language. It explores what innate capacities humans must be born with in order to learn a language, how the forms of human languages relate to the cultures and environments those languages are spoken within, and the extent to which language and thought may shape one another.� We will consider big questions like:  How can humans get an idea from one mind to another via language? In what sense is meaning located in language? Why are the world's 7000 languages so different from one another? To what extent do these differences between languages�reflect and reproduce differences in culture, environment, and/or ways of thinking? How is language manipulated to shape peoples beliefs and behaviours? 	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Indigenous languages of Australia	ATS3677	Two hundred years ago, between 250 - 800 Indigenous languages were spoken in Australia. These languages were incredibly diverse, though there are certain hallmarks of Indigenous Australian languages that most of them shared, including similar phonologies, cognate words, and recurrent patterns of meaning. This unit will present an overview of the features often considered typical of Australian Indigenous languages, and will explore how/whether these can be related to features of the various Indigenous cultures. This includes a consideration of the relationship between language and country, kinship and the sociocultural contexts of language use. We will also examine the roles of Indigenous languages in Australia today, including emergent Indigenous languages (such as mixed languages and creoles), multilingualism, language policy, sociolinguistics and the role of linguistics in language maintenance and revitalization.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Psycholinguistics and child language acquisition	ATS3679	The unit traces the development of child language from pre-speech to the later stages of acquisition, including the development of communicative competence. It examines the development of the child's phonological, syntactic, morphological and semantic system and attempts to account for this development by considering various linguistic models and theories.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Linguistics
Reflections on humanity: Truth, freedom and power	ATS3690	This unit seeks to illuminate the current crisis of humanity by looking at the work of three key figures in recent political theory - Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. Each of these theorists has interrogated the relationship between politics and barbarism at the most profound level and attempted to salvage a concept of humanity from the catastrophes of the twentieth century. Pivoting around themes of truth, freedom and power, their work draws us back to fundamental questions about the purposes and possibilities of politics as a human endeavour. Engaging with them will help to shed light on what might be hoped for human beings, individually and collectively, in the future.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Public policy	ATS3695	The unit examines the factors that shape public policy outcomes and the consequences (both deliberate and unintended) that result from particular policy choices. The unit focuses principally on liberal democracies and is divided into three sections. Section one traces the theoretical and normative debates associated with the state in the policy making process, including an examination of the evolution of the state. Section two explores the institutions and actors that are central to policy making process. The course concludes with an investigation of a number of key policy areas.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations

In the first part, students will gain an understanding of the relationship between gender and security with particular focus on violence during armed conflict, war and peace. In the second part, we look closely at how gender shapes national and cultural identities and development and human rights discourses. We will also pay attention to the role of the (global) media and transnational feminism in shaping and contesting gender roles and norms.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Knowledge and power in world politics	ATS3705	How does power operate in world politics? What is the relationship between power and knowledge about world politics? This unit introduces students to debates in the discipline of International Relations that focus on epistemological questions (or how we know what we know). Students will examine foundational, critical, post-structuralist, feminist and post-colonial approaches to knowledge and power within the discipline and explore their implications for key contemporary issues such as the rise of China and the legacies of colonialism. Contending theoretical perspectives offer different possibilities for interpreting politics and acting politically. The unit aims to develop students' critical awareness of the relationship between the politics of knowledge and our options for political practice.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations

Modern political thought	ATS3719	Modern political theorists grapple with significant political and social transformations such as capitalism, bureaucratisation, rationalisation and globalization. They diagnose various 'pathologies' they fear might result from these transformations: alienation and injustice, disenchantment and authoritarianism, nihilism and social disintegration. They also identify political solutions to these maladies: revolutionary action, charismatic leadership, new forms of democracy and citizenship, or new types of social movements. This unit examines and assesses modern political theorists' diagnoses of and cures for modern society, focusing on how they conceptualise key political concepts such freedom, power, community and legitimacy. It will do so by examining the political theories of Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Foucault, Habermas and other contemporary critical theorists.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Population and society	ATS3725	The unit examines Australian population issues and their social dimensions. The components of demographic change will be examined, as will the dramatic social consequences of population change.

The unit will be delivered through a mix of seminars and practicals and will draw upon student's recent or concurrent experience of work.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	School of Media, Film and Journalism
Global communications	ATS3760	People and nations in the 21st century are globally inter-connected. The unit explores why and how communication, underpinned by the innovations of Information and Communications Technologies, is a key contributor to globalising processes in political, economic and socio-cultural fields. The central focus is to examine Global Communications as an established and legitimate process which is strongly influenced by these processes. Topics include the relationships between Global Communications and global economy, politics, military operations, inequality, diplomacy/espionage, and cultural expressions.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Communications and Media Studies
English as an international language: Writing across cultures	ATS3781	"With English being an international language, using only one pattern of writing in English as the 'best' model because English speaking countries are the 'exclusive sole owners' of the language may no longer be relevant. What is considered to be ""good or bad writing"" in English, therefore, deserves thorough and critical investigation. This unit encourages students to investigate a variety of English writing practices in intercultural communication contexts. It enables students to challenge the assumption behind 'standard' and 'conventional' writing practices in English, as well as to discuss key aspects and features of writing in English for international communication."	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	English as an International Language

It raises philosophical questions about the role of religious discourse and the relationship of evidence to religious belief, examining classic texts on questions such as omniscience, simplicity and eternity. It also examines religious pluralism, and the range of responses that can be made to diverse views about salvation or enlightenment.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Making history: Research and writing	ATS3865	What do historians do and how do they do it? In this unit you will explore these key questions: (1) by examining the historiographical debates and theoretical preoccupations that have shaped the discipline in recent decades; (2) through the design and execution of an original research project. You will examine various (sub)fields and concepts crucial to the historians craft, as well as critically review traditional practices and how they are being reshaped by processes such as digitisation, globalisation, and new media. Examining audiences will also play an important role, with the growing recognition that history speaks to different people in different ways. The student-designed research project can cover any historical period or place of the students choosing, limited only by the availability of primary and secondary materials. You will have the option to submit your research in a non-traditional form (e.g., podcast).	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Crimes of the powerful	ATS3866	�Students examine crimes and social harms committed by powerful groups including states and corporations. The unit observes conceptual models for making sense of corporate, state and different forms of fraud and white-collar crimes. Key questions explored include: what is the extent and impacts associated with crimes of the powerful in our community? How do we determine intent and culpability where the actions of powerful agents create social harm? How are these crimes policed or regulated and prosecuted? The unit examines the relationships between government, business and criminal justice, and aims to locate the nexus of power that make these crimes possible. In order to build understandings about victimisation and prosecution outcomes, case studies are drawn upon and include financial fraud, workplace and industrial harms, environmental disasters, professional misconduct, tax avoidance and organisational and corporate crimes. Case studies assist to build understandings about the difficulties involved in defining and classifying these activities as crimes while also highlighting limitations involved in prosecuting and researching crimes of the powerful. Students will explore a range of sociological and criminological theories to explain the impacts of these crimes and document techniques involved in regulating them.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Political philosophy	ATS3869	The overarching aim of this unit is to give students a strong foundation in political philosophy. The unit focuses on core questions central to the discipline. Examples can include: How should wealth and income be distributed in the just state? What is the meaning of equality, and how does a just state respect it, given religious and cultural diversity? What is the meaning and value of liberty? When is it justified to punish someone for violating a state's laws? Should political philosophers strive to articulate a conception of ideal justice, or an account of justice more feasible for the actual world? Students will be introduced to central attempts to answer questions like these, using both classical and contemporary authors	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Philosophy of religion	ATS3870	This unit investigates central topics in the philosophy of religion.

Philosophical issues in applied ethics	ATS3873	This unit examines key philosophical issues and concepts in contemporary applied ethics, focusing on more advanced philosophical discussions in this area. The unit considers issues and concepts in ethical debates about the beginning and the end of life, such as the status of human life, persons, and potential persons, along with acts and omissions, the doctrine of double effect, and personal identity questions raised by advance directives.  The unit also investigates conceptual and ethical issues raised by debates about genetic interventions and access to assisted reproduction, such as the nature and moral significance of eugenics, disability, and wrongful life, and notions of parenthood.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Monash Bioethics Centre
Knowledge, belief, and action	ATS3876	This unit concerns epistemological questions such as what is knowledge? How do we form beliefs? How do our beliefs inform our decisions and actions? The focus may be on contemporary debates about scepticism and the definition of knowledge, or approach the topic through the lens of decision theory, theories of rationality, or how knowledge is acquired through science. The focus can also be on ways in which epistemology is challenged, for example in hallucinations, dreams and delusions, or in issues around notions of 'fake news', knowledge resistance, and biases &amp; heuristics, or more generally around the possibility of disagreement and changing ones mind.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
Metaphysics	ATS3882	The primary focus of metaphysics is fundamental reality. Metaphysicians develop, and debate, competing conceptions of what there fundamentally is, and what it is fundamentally like. Broad categories that can be the focus of metaphysical investigation include: objects, properties, states, functions, events, values, minds, causes, dispositions, space, time, propositions and numbers. Broad topics that can be taken up include: ontological commitment, composition, supervenience, reduction, fundamentality, and social kinds. From semester to semester, the selected menu of categories and topics will change; in every semester, a range of important metaphysical categories and topics will be investigated. Typically, the chosen categories and topics will be investigated through the lens of a particular theme: e.g. social ontology, levels of reality, idealism, Buddhist ontology, metaphysical naturalism, etc.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
History of philosophy: happiness	ATS3885	This unit examines different philosophical approaches to the question: How can I be happy? From ancient times to the present, philosophers have offered guidance on how human beings might attain an enduring state of well-being or flourishing. In the Hellenistic period, some proposed that the key to such happiness was freedom from mental disturbance and pain, while others recommended a life of complete emotional detachment. In the early modern era, philosophers argued that the solution lay with either calming the emotions or turning them into excellences of character, such as benevolence and self-esteem. In this unit, we analyse the moral, epistemological, and metaphysical dimensions of the topic of happiness across different periods in the history of philosophy.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy
American Literature	ATS3888	In this unit, students will examine a range of novels, short stories, and poems which illuminate major themes in United States literature from the nineteenth century through to today. Topics explored may include: what it means to be 'American' and who decides; race and class division; the legacies of chattel slavery and colonial dispossession; regional differences; immigration and Jewish-American experience; gender and sexuality; the relationship between literature and popular culture.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Egypt's golden age	ATS3890	This unit presents an archaeological study of New Kingdom Egypt when the country was one of the dominant powers in the Mediterranean. At the height of the Late Bronze Age, the kings of Egypt were leaders in the intensive elite trading network that created an internationalism of unprecedented scale across the Mediterranean. Combining material, visual and textual evidence with current approaches to archaeology, the unit examines the character of Egyptian culture and its international contacts through four main phases within the New Kingdom: the reigns of the female king Hatshepsut and her co-regent Thutmose III; Amenhotep III to Tutankhamun; Seti I and Ramesses II; and Ramesses III.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Ancient Cultures
Jazz arranging: Contemporary arranging techniques for small groups to large ensembles	ATS3899	This unit introduces students to jazz arranging styles and methodologies for small and large ensembles. Through listening tasks and score analysis, the unit explores various arranging concepts including form, instrumental range, register, blend, voicing techniques, rhythm-section writing as well as score preparation using notation software. Students then apply newly learned skills to the formulation and development of musical works, gaining practical feedback and experience via in-class performance workshops.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music
Leaders, power and politics	ATS3903	Leadership is indispensable to politics. Yet leadership is a problematic concept within liberal democracies that have traditionally set out to devolve authority and check against concentrations of power. This unit explores political leadership within liberal democracies using Australia (prime ministers) and the United States (presidents) as its primary empirical reference points. It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
American empire: The United States from colonies to superpower	ATS3908	We investigate key events, from the dispossession of indigenous peoples to a series of wars at home and abroad, and consider how ideas about race, manifest destiny and national exceptionalism drove this expansion. The unit looks at different expressions of power, including hard and soft power, and asks whether 'empire' is the right term to describe America's influence. We end by assessing whether the United States will continue to play the role of global superpower in the 21st century.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History
Performance studies 2 - Cultures	ATS3912	This unit provides an opportunity for in-depth study of a specific non-Western performative culture or group of practices, or a tradition outside the scope of mainstream theatre.

Methodologies and concepts of Performance Studies will be given practical application.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Theatre and Performance
Human rights discourse	ATS3916	Most people are familiar with the concept and language of human rights. But what is the origin of the contemporary conception and practice of human rights? Does it come from the French Revolution? Early modern philosophy? Or does our current understanding of human rights have a more recent origin? This unit will introduce students to debates about the history of human rights as a recognisable political discourse, and competing conceptions of what human rights are. We will then explore the implications of these debates for the practice of human rights, focusing on issues such as humanitarian intervention, and the work of NGOs.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Philosophy

Crime and the city	ATS3942	This course examines the concentration of crime in cities and urban communities and places the role of context at the centre of inquiry. It focusses on how local environments, geography, physical locations and residents perceptions and actions influence and shape crime. Students will learn how cities differ from rural or regional environments in their crime rates and will critically engage with why crime and other social problems concentrate in cities and neighbourhoods, not only in Australia, but globally. The course is broken down into four modules: What is a city and how do cities differ?; How and where do social problems concentrate?; What are the key theories and perspectives that explain the concentration of crime; and How do prevent crime in cities and communities? Seminars, in class activities, field trips and labs will highlight how crime and responses to crime are shaped by spatial inequality, ethnic/racial segregation and diversity, and competing interests in access and use of public spaces	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Criminology
Advanced creative writing	ATS3943	The unit examines contemporary creative writing and its applicability to writing practice through a comparative approach. The subject concentrates on a number of key texts by major contemporary writers and examines various works which may be seen to exemplify, modify, or challenge these stylistic models. Students will be required to reflect both creatively and analytically on their ongoing writing practice in the light of these texts. In the collaborative environment of workshops, students will be encouraged to experiment with a range of techniques and styles, developing editorial and drafting skills suitable to publication outcomes.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Writing the nation: Australian and Irish literature	ATS3944	Writers have felt compelled to define national identity in response to crises, from international conflicts to changes in the status of religion, and the effects of globalisation. With reference to such contexts, this unit explores the relationship between writing and belonging. Does literature produced in a particular nation affirm or challenge what we see as a unique national identity? How do creative works contribute to formations and interrogations of identity, ideology, gender, ethnicity and sexuality in a national context? This unit considers the search for national identity in literary forms such as poetry, drama, and the short story. There will be an emphasis on twentieth- and twenty-first century texts, across a range of genres.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Literary Studies
Japanese popular culture and identity	ATS3951	This capstone unit consolidates general knowledge about Japan and its popular culture by approaching popular cultures as a means by which personal and national identities are constructed.  Popular culture, in this instance, is considered as a directive as well as a reflection of collective ideology. The genre of manga and anime, television and film, music, fashion and food cultures provide the contexts for students deepening their understanding of Japan's postwar cultural history; the role of new media and technology in society; personal identity as expressed through consumption and lifestyle; and important cultural expressions of socio-political resistance to hegemony.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Japanese Studies
Trauma and memory in the modern world	ATS3956	This unit focuses on the histories, theories, and applications of conceptions of trauma in relation to events from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It explores trauma from international and interdisciplinary perspectives: as a concept that spans such areas as psychology, film and media studies, literature, history, philosophy, and anthropology, among others. In turn, that exploration will help illuminate a number of transnational and transhistorical case studies that may include: the rise and scope of modernity from a global perspective at the turn of the nineteenth century; war traumas associated with both past and current conflicts spanning Europe, Asia, and the Middle East; experiences of political and social struggles, human rights violations, and genocides taking place throughout the globe; issues of colonization and decolonization; the perpetration of sexual and gender-based violence worldwide; and to the study of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and other classifications of individual and collective suffering that shape how traumatic histories are remembered and represented	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation
Medieval Italy: Sites of encounter	ATS3957	This unit explores medieval Italy from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries as a site of encounter between a range of religious and cultural traditions: Islam, Judaism and both Latin and Greek Christianity, all sharing a common debt to classical antiquity. Taught in Prato, but involving travel to various locations in Italy. The unit provides an opportunity to understand the complex web of cultural interactions between Islam and Christianity in Sicily and southern Italy, as well as between Christians and Jews in Tuscany and other parts of northern Italy. It thus provides a wider context to understand medieval Italy and the writings of Dante in particular. The unit will involve close analysis of the built environments of medieval Italy and of the cultural artefacts surviving from the period to examine how both religious segregation and interaction shaped its culture.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Centre for Religious Studies

Nationalism and the European Union	ATS3974	Nationalism and war have been crucial motors of international relations, not least in Europe the birthplace of the Westphalian state system. The European Union is commonly seen as an antidote to nationalism and war in Europe; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012. Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently. As a result, students in this unit will analyse the relationship between European Unity, nationalism and war since 1945, including: the founding moment of European unity at the end of the Second World War; the role of anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies; EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia; the role of Europe among secessionist movements and in the nationalist responses to the challenges posed by the EUs current crises. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened in the face of national-populist critiques. This development poses serious questions about the future shape of the state system in the Euro-Atlantic region and in the wider world.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	Politics and International Relations
Japanese communication in professional settings	ATS3978	The unit provides advanced students of the Japanese language with theoretical and practical knowledge of the socio-cultural and communicative challenges in workplaces where the Japanese language is used, and the strategies employed to tackle those challenges.

Blood and guts: A history of medicine in Europe	ATS3995	Held in London, the unit aims to introduce students to the history of medicine in Europe. Far from value-free, medical knowledge and practice is everywhere and always embedded in a social, political, economic, and cultural context. We will probe these entwined historical experiences through an analysis of the written texts, visual sources, and material artefacts left by patients and practitioners. The focus will be on the period from the eighteenth century through to the present, when technological innovation revolutionised medical care and life expectancy increased dramatically. Topics may include: patient experiences; medical professions and professionalisation; medical technologies and epistemologies; authoritative knowledge and power in the clinic and in the laboratory; medicine and colonialism; relationship between mind and body.� Great Britain is an optimal location for a deep dive into the history of medicine. A global hub of medical history, London offers many and varied venues for exploring this topic. More than two dozen specialised museums and libraries in and around the city highlight one or more aspect(s) of the history of medicine, while numerous other collections feature fine art and material culture relevant to its study. Thanks to its prominent role in medical innovations of the Enlightenment, Edinburgh offers its own unique story accessible through local museums and libraries. For students with an interest in public history or museum studies, this is an ideal opportunity to think critically about those fields.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	History

Hazards of aviation environment	AVM5002	Understanding the various hazards to human health which are unique and specific to the aviation environment is crucial in developing countermeasures to protect humans from the adverse health effects of such exposures. As a specialised subset of occupational medicine, aviation medicine requires an understanding of how to recognise, evaluate and control hazards to health that are specific to the aircraft environment. In this unit students will explore the various aviation-specific hazards that pose risks for aircraft occupants. Topics will include: the fundamentals of health surveillance and risk management, the various physical, chemical, biological and radiation hazards associated with the aviation environment, and specific issues relating to modern air travel such as cabin air quality, food and water on aircraft, waste management systems, communicable diseases and passenger fitness to fly.	postgraduate	Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences	School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine
Clinical aviation medicine	AVM5003	Flying an aircraft is a demanding and challenging task. Ensuring the safety of the flight operation requires that pilots are medically fit to fly. This in turn requires the aviation medicine practitioner to apply good clinical knowledge in combination with awareness of the flight environment in order to make an appropriate aeromedical decision on a pilots' fitness to fly. Such decisions can be complex and challenging. To meet this challenge, a deep understanding of clinical medicine in the context of the aviation environment, and the processes and issues involved in making aeromedical decisions, is crucial. In this unit students will explore the principles of clinical aviation medicine, and the application of those principles to the aeromedical decision-making process, using case-based teaching, videos and online discussion.

Human Factors in Aviation	AVM5005	Flying an aircraft is largely a cognitive task in the modern air transport environment. Any factor that can affect cognitive performance of a pilot can have an adverse effect on flight safety. The human factors that can affect pilot performance are many and varied. They must be considered along with the typical medical and physiological factors that can influence pilot performance. This is especially true given the rapid technological changes in aviation. It is critically important that the aviation medicine practitioner has a deep understanding of human factors in the aviation environment. In this unit students will explore the principles of human factors in aviation, and how these human factors can affect pilot performance and flight safety, using case-based teaching, videos and online discussion. Topics will include: perception, memory, stress, workload, attention, human error, situational awareness, decision-making, automation, communication, ergonomics and crew resource management. �	postgraduate	Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences	School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine
Aviation safety and accident intervention	AVM5006	Flying an aircraft is not without risk. However, the aviation industry has made enormous progress in making air travel one of the safest forms of transport. When an incident or accident occurs, the aircraft accident investigation process is designed to uncover what happened and to identify corrective actions to be taken so as to prevent future accidents. In some cases, human performance limitations such as medical events or human factors issues play causal or contributory roles in the accident. Aaviation medicine practitioners can be involved in aviation safety through the accident investigation process. As such, it is critically important that aviation medicine practitioners have a comprehensive understanding of the principles of aviation safety and the accident investigation process. In this unit students will explore the principles of aviation safety and accident investigation, using case-based teaching, videos and online discussion. Topics will include: accident investigation models, investigating agencies, aviation safety in perspective, safety culture, safety management systems, crash dynamics, injury protection, aircrew survival and aviation pathology. �	postgraduate	Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences	School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine

Ethics and the modern world	AZA2939	The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. The theories of utilitarianism and deontology will be examined within the South African context and judged according to ethical dilemmas that arise within the country. Key to this examination will be a discussion of the role of friendship and family within ethical decision-making. A major focus of discussion is the opposition between consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, which judge rightness and wrongness solely in terms of consequences, and the Kantian theory of deontology which judges rightness and wrongness according to whether the act is in accordance with rational will. The question that will guide this discussion is whether these theories can account for the agent-centred reasons which arise from relations of love and friendship and which seem to have the potential to conflict with impartial moral requirements?	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	South Africa School of Social Science
Competing models of political economy	AZA3010	The defining feature of our age is the spread of capitalism to almost every corner of the globe. However, the victory of market economics has not removed the state from the realm of economic decision-making. Even the most market-oriented systems exist within political frameworks that enforce contracts, resolve disputes, regulate negative externalities, and provide public goods. Furthermore, capitalism remains intensely controversial. It has created unprecedented wealth and prosperity, but has also suffered from periodic crises, and critics argue that it has exacerbated inequality and damaged the natural environment. In this unit, Monash students learn how to evaluate these competing claims. Students will be introduced to competing models of political economy, learn about key thinkers in the history of economic thought, and gain insight into the intersection between markets and political power.	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	South Africa School of Social Science
War, peace and international security	AZA3015	"A perennial concern in politics, especially at the international level, is the problem of war and security. Violent conflict has been a feature of human society for millennia. Today, we are arguably living in a period unprecedented global peace, but there are still numerous countries and regions that are plagued by ongoing conflicts. These range from civil conflicts in Africa, to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, the ""war on terror"" in the Middle-East, and other low-intensity and unconventional conflicts throughout the world. In addition, the emergence of China as a nascent military superpower, combined with the relative decline of the United States, has raised fears of a 'hegemonic transition': a delicate period that, in previous historical periods, has often been accompanied by intense security competition and war. This course will equip Monash students with the theoretical and practical knowledge to understand these issues, which rank as being among the important problems in politics."	undergraduate	Faculty of Arts	South Africa School of Social Science

The discussion is motivated by reference to econometric and statistical models and data, and simple practical examples with which you should be familiar. It is shown that these methods find application in many areas of econometrics and business statistics, and may be viewed as encompassing many familiar econometric and statistical techniques. Broad topic headings are: quasi-MLE, classical method of moments and regression (OLS and IV), GMM, identification, non-parametric methods, the bootstrap, asymptotic distribution theory and optimal inference. Simulation experiments are used to reinforce the theoretical derivations.	postgraduate	Faculty of Business and Economics	Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics

Creativity and entrepreneurship	BEX5411	Have you ever had a great idea and been unsure about how to bring it to life? Or found a wicked problem but not known how to solve it? Or maybe you have wondered how seemingly successful people pitching their businesses on stage, got to that point. Innovation and entrepreneurship is often shrouded in mysticism and hyperbole, with lightning bolts seemingly striking as geniuses appear with a breakthrough idea. The truth is, to truly be creative, entrepreneurial and innovative, you need to do a lot of hard work, but the rewards can be incredible. In this unit, students are placed into start-up style teams that focus on addressing a real world challenge; from defining a clear problem to solve, through to coming up with a solution, building a business model around it, and then pitching your venture to a panel of industry experts. This is a hands-on, experiential unit, with a focus on building entrepreneurial and creative mindsets, and practical skills. Teams will follow industry leading frameworks spanning design thinking, lean experimentation and business modelling to collaboratively bring sophisticated, considered and innovative business concepts to life.	postgraduate	Faculty of Business and Economics	Faculty of Business and Economics
Technology and innovation for start-ups	BEX5413	Technology, increasingly impacts upon life in both measurable and immeasurable ways. Without it, life as we know would be a very different and most probably, rather stark experience. Innovation is often explicitly and implicitly bound with technology as knowledge and the way we use knowledge drives rapid advances that can both add to our lives but also at times result in unforeseen implications. This unit examines technology and innovation from a human-centred perspective providing a broad overview of the technology landscape and how this drives innovation that impacts on human lives and by consequence, all life. Technological advances can enable economic growth and diversity and this course, in a practical manner, will highlight how technology can be leveraged in transforming nascent concepts into commercial realities. The unit adopts a design-driven innovation perspective and demonstrates how a human-centred lens is applied when developing new products, services and technologies. Philosophically, nascent innovators will be challenged in this unit to test and validate (in an applied sense), appropriate technology for different types of innovations that may either underpin a start-up or facilitate more optimal and efficient operations of one. This unit will also focus on the architecture that supports technology and how this relates to the start-up journey and achieving profitability. You will be exposed to the most current emerging deep technologies including AI, IoT, machine learning and bots but also not overlook less glamorous tech where scope still exists for considerable innovation. This will allow students to more comprehensively explore the interplay between innovation, technology, and delivery to market.	postgraduate	Faculty of Business and Economics	Monash Business School

Food security in a changing world	BIO2030	Food security is defined as when all people at all times have access to enough food and a balanced diet. This depends on the production of food (agricultural yield), the availability of food (distribution, cost) and its nutritional value. Underpinning all food security are plants, whether eaten directly or consumed by stock animals. This interdisciplinary unit will examine the factors that govern crop yields, e.g. how plants detect and respond to changing environments. The unit will also address the nutritional value of foods by exploring what is a balanced diet, how do we get it and its effects on animal physiology and health.� The United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a challenge to the global community to improve human well-being, while also conserving Earths natural resources and the vital ecological functions on which we all depend. Goal Two, zero hunger, is relevant to the unit alongside many other interconnected goals. Meeting food production goals in the face of climate change, requires new approaches to agriculture and land management. The strengths and weaknesses of different agricultural systems (e.g. organic, subsistence, greenhouses or broadacre farming) and the role GMOs, digital agriculture and robotics will be discussed. The unit will assist you to prepare for employment in food- and agriculture-related industries, with an awareness of sustainability principles and regenerative agriculture. A work integrated learning assignment incorporating a half-day off-campus field trip will be an option.	undergraduate	Faculty of Science	School of Biological Sciences

The practical component comprises group field projects in tropical rainforests.	undergraduate	Faculty of Science	Malaysia School of Science
Evolutionary ecology	BIO3020 	This unit introduces key concepts in evolutionary ecology, equipping students with the knowledge and research skills necessary to study the evolutionary processes that shape ecological patterns. The unit commences with a refresher of fundamental definitions of evolution, selection, and adaptation. You will then apply this knowledge to the study of life-history theory, seeking to come up with answers for how organisms should allocate their limited resources to survival and reproduction, to maximise their fitness. You will then turn your attention to questions that have persistently captivated the attention of biologists  why do we grow old, how do new species emerge, and why do males and females of many species look and behave so differently? The unit goes on to explore the genetic basis of evolution, through examination of fundamental evolutionary principles and approaches including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, fitness, adaptive genetic variation, heritability of complex traits and their response to natural selection. This leads on to exploration of how evolutionary principles and genetic information can be applied to understand ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes in the wild, including the capacity of populations to adapt to rapidly changing environments.	undergraduate	Faculty of Science	Faculty of Science

We then go on to explore the way in which behaviour develops during the animal's early life and the various influences that shape this development before moving on to examine the genetic regulation of behaviour, how behaviour evolves and how we can use comparative methods to study this process. The rest of the unit is then devoted to behavioural ecology which deals with the role of behaviour in the animal's interactions with its environment and the ways in which the environment shapes adaptive behaviour on an evolutionary time scale. Topics covered in this area include foraging and anti-predator behaviour, social organisation, mating systems and parental care.	undergraduate	Faculty of Science	School of Biological Sciences
Advanced ecology and evolution	BIO3070	This unit will investigate what's hot in the science of ecology and evolution, and how we got there by following the history of ecological ideas and the people behind them through to the big questions that remain unanswered in ecology and evolution today. The ecological dimensions of space and time will be a common theme running through the unit as we explore the ecology of fitness, interaction networks and the four 'M's - metacommunity ecology, metasystems, metabolic ecology and macroecology. Underpinning all of this will be the recognition of the interplay between ecology and evolution that is blurring the distinction between the two disciplines. Each topic and its core concepts will be covered in lectures and the relevance of these topics to the changing world and to conservation will be discussed. Material presented in lectures will be supported by practical and tutorial sessions. Together we will read and interpret 'hot off the press' ecology and evolution research papers, debate controversial topics in the field, delve into live data and design experiments to answer unsolved problems.	undergraduate	Faculty of Science	School of Biological Sciences

Unconventional publishing	CDS2524	Unconventional publishing is a unit for those wishing to explore new models of physical publishing involving designer-generated content. Various methods and rationales - both creative and pragmatic - for the instigation of self-initiated projects will be investigated. The unit explores the possibility of communication design as an autonomous creative practice. The definition of publishing has expanded to include such diverse practices as websites, books, phone-based media, magazines, public posters, etc. In particular, small publishers have become more numerous and specialised, while traditional mass-market publishing is undergoing a slow decline. There are many examples of such small publishers being led by designers. Merging the traditionally separate roles of content-generator, editor, designer, publisher, printer and distributor reflects contemporary trends in communication design and provides a holistic overview of publishing as discipline. The unit approaches this breadth of publishing as a contiguous practice that can be overseen by an individual or small group and therefore encourages the development of projects outside of the traditional client/designer relationship.	undergraduate	Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture	Department of Design

Behavioural economics	ECC2600	Research in economics has increasingly incorporated fields such as psychology, sociology, and biology. Together with this, the methods in economic research have expanded to include designed experiments and more recently advanced technology such as fMRI. Findings from such empirical research, along with interactions with other fields using the new methods, provide valuable input for the development of new models of economic behaviour and improve the applicability of economic theories. This unit introduces findings in psychology, behavioural and experimental economics and discuss alternative models of individual decisions and the related implications in economic exchange.	undergraduate	Faculty of Business and Economics	Department of Economics
Game theory and strategic thinking	ECC2610	Game theory offers a tool for strategic thinking. It can be thought of as the art of beating your rivals, knowing that they are trying to do the same to you. Individuals, firms, governments and nations behave strategically, for good and bad. Over the last few decades, game theory has been developed for the purpose of understanding social phenomena. It has become the major tool used by social scientists to understand, predict and regulate strategic interaction among agents who have conflicting interests. This unit provides an introduction to game theory with an emphasis on real-world cases, including applications in economics and business.	undergraduate	Faculty of Business and Economics	Department of Economics

History of economic thought	ECC3800	"This unit covers the thought of the greatest minds in the history of the discipline of economics. Its main organising principle is the question: ""what is the economic problem?"" This unit organises the history of thought around two widely different answers. First, the classical economists starting with Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, and culminating with Marx, argue that the economic problem is about the production of surplus. Second, the neoclassical economists starting in 1872 with the writings of Jevons, Walras, and Menger, argue that the economic problem is about the efficient allocation of resources among competing ends. In addition, this unit covers issues related to the philosophy of science, moral theory, the limits of natural resources, social contract theory of the state, modernism, utilitarianism, evolutionary biology, and a secondary question that has been raised by Say's law and questioned by Keynes: is the market system stable?"	undergraduate	Faculty of Business and Economics	Department of Economics

Network economics	ECC3841	The explosive changes in our abilities to communicate over distancesspurred on by the evolution of communication technologies, coupled with the increased capabilities of the internet and social mediahave made social networks very salient. An important reason for studying networks is to understand how networks affect behaviour. People often form relationships because they wish to be connected to other individuals for economic reasons, such as the benefits of collaboration, exchange and sharing of information. Network economics offers a tool for the analysis of the interaction of agents who are connected via a network and whose behaviours are influenced by those around them. This unit provides an introduction to network economics with an emphasis on real-world applications, including crime, education, labour, development economics, industrial organisation, political economy, financial economics, etc.	undergraduate	Faculty of Business and Economics	Department of Economics

Numeracy and mathematics for learning and life	EDF2161	This unit addresses the key questions of what the similarities and distinctions are between numeracy and mathematics. Although numeracy is sometimes thought of as a subset of mathematics, it can also be seen as encompassing a different set of aims and objectives. For example, the power of 'pure' mathematics can be thought of as resting in the pleasure that mathematicians gain from 'playing' with mathematics for its own sake, and the resultant ever more abstract nature of the subject. In contrast, being numerate means working in the opposite direction: looking for the mathematics potentially 'hidden' in the world and drawing on quantitative skills to question particular issues. Numeracy is linked to being able to make critically informed judgements, judgements for which mathematical knowledge in itself may not equip one. By addressing such issues the unit develops both your understanding of numeracy and mathematics and what this means for you as teachers and future leaders of numeracy in schools.	undergraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education

Skills such as critical analysis, synthesis of complex information, problems and concepts will be developed in practitioner research contexts.	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education
Content, pedagogy and pedagogical content knowledge in STEM education	EDF5302	This unit introduces and explores the notion of expert educator knowledge underpinning STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and STEM education. In particular, it focuses on the interplay between pedagogical knowledge and content knowledge theoretically conceptualised as pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). While there have been many examples of PCK as the basis for expert educator knowledge, exploring this concept in STEM education disrupts many assumptions in relation to the knowledge base of expert educators. The unit focuses on the ways in which STEM challenges the notion of knowledge as an individual attribute (belonging to a person), instead considering the knowledge as being distributed amongst people and significantly how this knowledge base is dynamic and therefore changes over time. You will be challenged to consider the ways in which a dynamic, distributed conceptualisation of knowledge can start to shift and shape our views about STEM pedagogy. Within the unit, there is a strong focus on theoretical explorations of STEM knowledge, STEM pedagogies and the development of an identity as a STEM leader together with pragmatic considerations of the ways in which these ideas shape STEM as a true interdisciplinary field which requires collaboration between educators as much as it does from students. This unit will challenge STEM educators to consider the syntax and structure of STEM together with their emerging identity as a STEM leader.	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education
Digital foundations of STEM education	EDF5303	This unit builds your capacity in the purposeful and creative use of digital technologies as part of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education.

Throughout the unit opportunities will be made available to you to develop an understanding of how digital technologies can support STEM education. At the same time you will be exposed to contemporary research and debates regarding the role of digital technologies in STEM, STEM education and education more broadly, including significant issues such as access, equity, content representation, ethics and risk. Theory, research and practice will be brought together and you will be encouraged to practise a critical approach while designing the integration of digital technologies in your STEM education programs. Such an approach includes new and emerging approaches to engaging students in STEM education through digital technologies and practices such as 'making', coding programming, game-based learning, data visualisation and flipped classrooms. In-class activities may include engaging in STEM debates related to pre- and post-class materials as well as practical hands-on applications of digital technologies such as the programming of personal data collection devices or the creation of stop-animation. Pre- and post-class activities may include reading of academic texts, watching 'flipped' class materials such as videos, quizzes, and individual and collaborative creation of digital artefacts. You will engage in hands-on application of digital technologies in relation to STEM education.

Contemporary practices of STEM education	EDF5304	This unit takes the knowledge, skills and capabilities developed in previous units of the course and uses these elements to examine contemporary STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) settings. A small STEM practice placement will be undertaken. This practical experience will provide you with an opportunity to engage as a learner in order to explore how as educators you may provide similar opportunities for authentic STEM learning experiences for others. The notion of what constitutes an authentic STEM learning experience is explored and examined. STEM education relies on the communication of STEM knowledge, processes and interaction to others and this unit provides a frame for interrogating these different communication strategies. Authentic experiences also need to be relevant to the learner, therefore what makes an experience relevant is critically examined. Additionally STEM skills, particularly creative and critical thinking, are important components of innovation and entrepreneurship. The opportunities for authentic STEM experience to provide these learning opportunities will also be considered.	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education

Enhancing education to work transitions and employability 	EDF5762	Within todays globalized and uncertain labour markets, the connection between education and work has gone far beyond the notion of using a qualification/degree to obtain stable employment. Your post-study career success is determined by your capacities in both securing immediate employment and sustaining employment. This unit is, therefore, designed to facilitate your successful education-to-work transitions and your employability sustainability. In particular, it will look at aspects including: gaps between the worlds of education and work with a focus on examining how curricular and extra-curricular activities prepare you for requirements and expectations of industries, issues facing young people on education-to-work transitions and required resources for successful education-to-work transitions and employability sustainability. A particular theme in this unit will be how these aspects occur and are applied to students with specific needs that derive from their life situations; for example: migrants, international students and students with special needs. Obtaining insights about these aspects will enable you to critically evaluate the roles of schools and universities and other stakeholders in preparing and supporting you for post-study career development. You should also be able to identify plausible career pathways and effective strategies for successful employability negotiation.	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education
Promoting and sustaining social and emotional learning in educational contexts 	EDF5763	Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) now forms a key component in most school policies and programming.� Educators and administrators are becoming increasingly aware of the new to reinforce emotional wellbeing in order to promote social cohesion. This unit focuses on five key SEL competencies introduced and reinforced in this unit include: self-awareness, social awareness, responsible decision-making, self-management and relationship skills. It uses a four-pronged teaching and learning approach.� At the outset, the unit focuses on developing an understanding for the importance of teachers knowing their own SEL. It examines existing theories on emotional intelligence and how teachers can identify their own strengths, limitations and attitudes towards teaching and student learning. Additionally, it looks at students and the importance for the teacher to recognize each individual student in their charge and the students personal SEL. It looks at key understandings that teachers should know and apply as they work on being more effective in their teaching and learning processes. Building on this, the unit considers how schools can successfully embed and expand SEL by understanding issues and constraints and addressing them proactively at the institutional level through decision-making models that use a strong research-based evidence, policy and practice nexus. Finally, it will explore how parents, families and communities through viable partnerships and relationships can provide contextual clarity to SEL in schools especially for the individual student.	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education

Globalisation and contemporary education 	EDF5765	Education is no longer restricted by national boundaries, with countries around the globe experiencing the effects of globalisation on multiple levels. The needs from and of individual education systems has shifted significantly, as people move between and among national boundaries, using their skill sets in a range of contexts. These shifting needs compels a regular evaluation of educational provision, within schools, tertiary institutions and workplaces. Educational needs now meet universal demands, as individuals move across the globe, taking their skill and knowledge with them. This migration of skill forces educators to evaluate the current provision of teaching and learning programs, reflecting on how contemporary education can meet these changing demands. This unit firstly considers the fluid dynamics of a globalised approach to education, and subsequently explores whether contemporary education is indeed accommodating the needs of an increasingly globalised world.�	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education

Child in context	EDF5777	In this unit, you will reflect on a range of contemporary perspectives of the child in context, with an emphasis on how contextual and environmental factors inform and shape discourses of the child within early childhood education. As a professional in the field, you will explore the range of contextual, environmental and bioecological factors which may impact on pedagogical decisions and approaches based on understandings of the child in context and the implications this has on understanding of the childs learning and development.� Among these contextual factors, you may explore contemporary issues such as family structures, cultural and linguistic backgrounds and socio-economic backgrounds, with a view to examining the learning and teaching implications. This will include, considering policy trends in relation to these contemporary issues, and in particular, policy discourse and its positioning of the child in context. You will also consider the influence of the media and the impact on the child in context.� This will be facilitated through an examination of the research within early childhood education, assisting you to develop a holistic and accurate perspective of the context.� At its core, this unit will focus on contextual elements which contribute and influence the development of the child.	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education
Research project in inclusive education and applied behaviour analysis	EDF5778	Creating equitable learning and teaching opportunities for marginalized and vulnerable populations has progressing become a feature of the social justice agenda. Additionally, both theoretical and pragmatic approaches have been explored to address social inequities, and steer toward the removal of barriers, fostering high equality education for all. Given this central tenet of inclusivity, it is notable that research processes are the exception rather than the norm. There is an apparent disjunction however between research conducted in the field and the enactment of practice to reduce social inequity. This gap represents a significant challenge for educators, governments and students that this unit will address. More specifically, this unit covers all aspects of the conduct of research with a specialist focus on inclusive education and applied behaviour analysis. You will undertake a study program in research design and under the guidance of a staff member, plan an independent research project. This project involves designing research in relation to previous work on the topic of the study, understanding how to gain ethical approval for data collection or use of data, data gathering, data entry and analysis using appropriate statistical or within-subject research techniques or methodologies, the preparation of a literature review and brief research report as the assessment tasks.	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education
Developing and evaluating positive behaviour support school programs and practices	EDF5779	Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) is a contemporary practice which acknowledges the potential of every child to succeed. This strengths-based approach is being established in many schools in Australia and abroad.� Consequently, school practitioners, who are implementing associated strategies require evidence-based strategies to support their initiatives. This unit offers you an opportunity to evaluate and critique school initiatives regarding positive behaviour support. The unit builds on existing understanding and knowledge relating to PBS practices at schools, extending this understanding through independent judgement supported by academic scholarship. Intended for practitioners and school leaders who would like to extend their skill and knowledge in this field, the unit will allow close exploration of contemporary practice. Such exploration considers individual school visions around PBS programs, specific programs of intervention within the multi-tiered systems of support and the impact on staff and students.� Additionally, it will reflect on details within the schools behaviour plan, and protocols that govern its implementation.� There will be opportunities to consider functional behaviour assessments in context, reflect on interventions and prevention plans, and critique the design and formulation of PBS programs at schools.�	postgraduate	Faculty of Education	Faculty of Education

Innovation to influence system change	ENS5510	Leadership toward sustainable development requires you to address complex problems that are often systemic and politically charged. This unit will empower you to make sense of large complex systems, use structured processes to influence change, and develop innovative ideas to create sustainable outcomes for real-world situations. You will learn key theories of system and political change and apply these to examine components of real systems we live in, such as transport, energy, water and more  their structures, rules, norms, values, politics and technology. This will enable you to clearly define problems, reveal and avoid biases and uncover root causes of systemic issues. Your strategic understanding of systems will let you recognise the factors that help or hinder sustainable development and identify opportunities for guided change. Having built this strategic understanding, you will then gain tactics and tools to innovate and influence change. Youll practice with industry-relevant methods and develop personal skills required to succeed across sectors and scales. These include collaborative processes, system mapping, creative visioning, rapid prototyping of ideas, advocacy and winning support for your initiatives.	postgraduate	Faculty of Science	Faculty of Science
Understanding human behaviour to influence change	ENS5520	Behavioural change approaches are an important, and often very cost effective, part of the mix of solutions to many sustainability and other public policy issues, such as water conservation, energy efficiency and immunisation. Considerable opportunities exist in this space, as comparatively little time and effort is usually invested in understanding the drivers of individual behaviour and designing solutions that target these drivers. With a mix of theoretical and practical work, this unit will enable you to understand individual behaviour in a way that identifies opportunities for change. It will take you through a process of unpacking public policy challenges and identifying real-life behavioural solutions. This involves prioritising behaviours and target audiences and understanding drivers of behaviour and potential solutions. You will also learn to work collaboratively to design, test and evaluate behaviour change interventions.	postgraduate	Faculty of Science	Faculty of Science
Leading change for sustainable development	ENS5530	Promoting sustainable development involves people working together to initiate and drive change. To do this, individuals and groups need leadership capacity. In this unit you will learn how to manage your own development as a leader, explore your values and purpose as an emerging sustainability leader, and reflect on which leadership roles are likely to suit you best. Starting with the concept of self-leadership, you will develop key skill sets that sustainability leaders need, and learn about approaches/strategies that are commonly used in this context. You will also have the opportunity to explore real case studies and learn from experienced sustainability leaders.We define leadership as a process of influence that delivers a shared vision (direction), the alignment of resources towards that vision, and personal commitment to collective success. From this perspective, leadership is not a position. It is a group-based process of influence that involves capacities that people and groups can learn. The unit differs from traditional MBA-style leadership education and training in that it focuses on the theoretical frameworks/models, leadership roles, case studies, tools and skill sets from the vast leadership literature that are most relevant to sustainable development practitioners.A key part of the unit is to build your own individual leadership development plan, drawing on concepts, principles and methods of sustainability leadership and leadership development that we explore over 12 weeks. This plan will describe the kind of sustainability leader you want to be, the aspects of leadership you are seeking to develop, and specific actions you intend to take to grow your leadership capacity, such as practising new approaches to sustainability leadership, seeking feedback, receiving support from mentors, and reflecting.	postgraduate	Faculty of Science	Faculty of Science

Programming paradigms	FIT2102	Ability to code in differently constructed programming languages is analogous to speaking in different natural languages with varying grammars. Similar to natural languages, programming languages from different paradigms (styles) vary in their expressiveness and efficiency. One programming language may require many screens-full of complex code to accomplish a task for which another requires but a few expressive lines of code. Therefore, understanding the design principles of programming languages enables computational problems to be implemented in dramatically different and powerful ways; leading, in some cases, to solutions that are more elegant, correct, maintainable, efficient and/or extensible. This unit examines a selection of programming languages and paradigms and explores the evolution of language design from low-level paradigms that are closer to the execution model of the machine, to more high-level declarative paradigms that allow programmers to model a problem precisely rather than specify its solution. The unit covers paradigms such as functional and declarative programming styles, comparing and contrasting them to programming styles that students are already familiar with, including object-oriented, imperative and procedural programming paradigms. We compare type systems supported by various languages, from scripting languages like JavaScript with weak type systems, to gradual typing as in TypeScript, to advanced compiled languages with strong type correctness, such as Haskell. We see these applied to data-modeling techniques (covering polymorphism, mutability-versus-purity, state management, and side-effects) and different models of execution such as strict-versus-lazy evaluation. The unit provides practical experience with using modern functional programming techniques, non-procedural, non-object-oriented programming languages and discusses the influence of programming language theory on the design of current main-stream computer languages, and how the theory translates to practice. A focus of the unit is that these techniques are applicable and ubiquitous in a variety of modern languages, for example, we will see how functional programming techniques are used in relatively conventional imperative languages like JavaScript, and compare and contrast this with pure functional languages, such as Haskell.	undergraduate	Faculty of Information Technology	Faculty of Information Technology

Data analytics	FIT3152	In recent years the world has seen an explosion in the quantity and variety of data routinely recorded and analyzed by research and industry, prompting some social commentators to refer to this phenomenon as the rise of &quot;big data,&quot; and the analysts and practitioners who investigate the data as &quot;data scientists.&quot; The data may come from a variety of sources, including scientific experiments and measurements, or may be recorded from human interactions such as browsing data or social networks on the Internet, mobile phone usage or financial transactions. Many companies too, are realising the value of their data for analysing customer behavior and preferences, recognising patterns of behaviour such as credit card usage or insurance claims to detect fraud, as well as more accurately evaluating risk and increasing profit. In order to obtain insights from big data new analytical techniques are required by practitioners. These include computationally intensive and interactive approaches such as visualisation, clustering and data mining. The management and processing of large data sets requires the development of enhanced computational resources and new algorithms to work across distributed computers. This unit will introduce students to the analysis and management of big data using current techniques and open source and proprietary software tools.

The global lawyer	LAW4250	The Global Lawyer focuses on international and transnational practice. It takes students beyond the traditional Australian and common law concentration. Students will be introduced to legal systems from other countries, explore strategies for international research, and develop skills necessary to practice in different cultures and systems, and to interact with clients and lawyers from other jurisdictions. This unit aims to introduce students to the increasingly important implications of practicing global law, and understanding the impact of digital technologies in legal practice, and in the lawyer's own professional identity, including the impact of social media. It seeks to make students aware of the opportunities in international practice as the role of traditional lawyering is broadened, as well as the responsibilities of being a global, digital lawyer. Students will start by exploring the origin of transnational practice, highlighting the importance of today's lawyer engaging in global practice. Students will then be introduced to the ethical concerns and responsibilities involved in being an international lawyer, before moving onto an overview of the domestic legal systems of important players in the international legal arena. A discussion of the impact of global legal practice on minorities within the legal community will encourage students to think of the larger socio-economic implications of cross-border practice. International management and firm operation will be dealt with as students are challenged with the problem of how to maintain local identity while providing international service. Students who have engaged in global lawyering experiences as a part of Monash's extensive global internship opportunities will be encouraged to give short presentations on their experiences. Students will critically engage with Richard Susskind's technological vision of legal practice, and explore the role of digital tools in the practice of law. Issues such as the changing use of digital technology, modern understandings of privacy and control over information, copyright and ownership of data, and issues of data retention, data security, legal informatics and legal professional ethics will be considered.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Chinese legal institutions and laws	LAW4252	This unit aims to provide students with a basic understanding of Chinese legal institutions.

Sport and the law	LAW4340	This Unit explores the intersection of sport and law and in so doing: 1. equips students to apply the body of knowledge known as &quot;sports law&quot;; and 2. consolidates, reinforces and extends students' knowledge and understanding of core legal subjects central to the practice of law. The Unit begins by examining the place of sport in our society, and how changes in society, and how society perceives sport (and sport perceives itself), has influenced the development and application of the law to sport. In doing so, the Unit will examine sport in its various guises, local, national and international; professional and amateur; contact and non-contact; and explore sports' social, cultural, economic and political importance. Next, the Unit explores the extent to which sport's &quot;specificity&quot; (its unique social and cultural standing and need for &quot;competitive balance&quot;) has seen legislatures and courts modify the application to it of traditional legal concepts. Areas to be examined include the application of criminal law to on-field violence; tort and OHS law to sports related injuries; contract and employment law to sports persons' employment contracts and collective bargaining agreements; and competition, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination law to the rules and practices by which sporting competitions are organised and conducted. The Unit then explores the development of unique legal rules and institutions tailored to sports persons and sporting activities. These include sports' anti-doping codes, rules concerning corruption, gambling and match-fixing, and unique systems of self-regulation and dispute resolution (e.g., World Anti-Doping Agency and Court for Arbitration of Sport).. Finally, the Unit concludes by considering the extent to which this body of knowledge evidences a specific corpus of jurisprudence recognisable as &quot;sports law&quot;, and what we can learn from it about the development of the law more generally. The Unit's focus is on domestic Australian law, but with an eye to how developments in other parts of the world could influence the evolution of the law and practice in Australia.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Sovereignty and globalisation	LAW4343	This unit will examine the relationship between sovereignty and globalisation from the 'discovery' of the Americas, through colonisation and de-colonisation, to present concerns with financial and technological integration and the 'war on terror'. It will ask what it means to be 'sovereign' in a globalised world and this question shapes and is shaped by the allocation of political and economic power in the world. The unit will place contemporary debates about sovereignty and globalisation in context by considering the development of sovereignty doctrine at key moments in history. It will also investigate the complex relationship between public and private authority.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Remedies	LAW4522	The unit in Remedies will consider the remedial goals of the common law, equity and some important statutes, as well as examine the legal rules and principles which give effect to these goals.  The focus will be on damages and coercive remedies. The course will begin by studying the principles underlying compensation before moving to restitution, punishment and coercion. While it will not be possible to look at every general law remedy, the major topics concerning the assessment of damages in tort and contract, misleading or deceptive conduct and for breach of equitable obligations will be studied.  Among the questions to be considered are:  With compensatory damages being the primary remedy for many torts and for breach of contract, what role is there for punishment and gain-based damages in our law of civil obligations and what remedies give effect to these goals? Why are the compensation rules for tort different from those for contract? How are they different? How do the doctrine of mitigation and other limiting factors affect compensation in common law?  In what ways does the assessment of damages for misleading or deceptive conduct differ from damages in tort and contract? Is compensation assessed differently where there is a breach of an equitable obligation? Should it be? When are injunctions and specific performance available, and what factors affect their availability? 	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

International and comparative trade mark law	LAW4535	This unit will provide an overview of the obligations under international law to provide protection to trade marks and a comparison of selected, key aspects of trade mark protection in Australia, the United States and the EU. Consequently, in relation to international law, it will examine the trade mark aspects of the TRIPS agreement (including consideration of geographical indications) and the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy of ICANN relating to domain names. To a lesser extent, deal with the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Madrid Protocol relating to multiple filings of trade mark applications. Selected, key aspects of comparison will include issues such as jurisdiction specific approaches to ownership, the requirements for registrability of trade marks such as shape trade marks and the different approaches to infringement, including dilution of trade marks and parallel importing. Other topics may include the registration and control of domain names. It is likely that, in light of Australian legislation and WTO challenges, the unit will also critically examine the arguments of the tobacco industry that international trade mark obligations prevent the implementation of plain packaging of cigarettes.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Public policy, regulation and the law	LAW4537	This Unit explores the interrelationship between public policy, regulation and the law. The Unit begins by introducing students to the policy cycle - the process by which issues (or problems) are identified and prioritised for action by government, and the action to be taken to address the issue (solve the problem) is agreed. In doing so, the Unit will expose students to some of the challenges facing governments and regulators when deciding whether and how to address a particular issue. The Unit also will introduce students to the breadth of tools available to governments to achieve their policy ends. In doing so, the Unit will explore how the concept of 'regulation' has expanded beyond the traditional legal concept of regulation as rules promulgated by a sovereign state, to include all the tools used by governments and other actors to alter or control the behaviour of people and other entities. The Unit will then explore some the theories, concepts and constructs that explain regulatory practice in a modern liberal capitalist society, before moving on to consider what may constitute 'good' regulation and regulatory practice. Finally, the Unit will explore how the law intersects with, supports and shapes public policy and the regulatory endeavour. Rather than focus on one substantive area of regulation, several case studies will be used to illustrate and highlight the general themes of the Unit. Moreover, the Unit will include aspects of politics, economics, public administration and public policy in its consideration of the issues, further developing students' skills in understanding and applying the law in its societal context.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Lawyers, literature and cinema	LAW4538	The representation of Law and lawyers within popular culture is one of the most important, but underappreciated, dimensions of the legal profession, of practice, and of the practical negotiation of legal ethics. The 'social status' of the lawyer within the wider culture is one of the dominant factors governing the student's decision to enter (or not to enter) law school. Furthermore, the dissemination of judicial procedure and dispute resolution through popular culture and the mass media is one of the primary means of both enforcing and challenging the legitimacy of Law and its practitioners within the broader community. Within the diverse representations of Law offered by popular culture both literature and cinema are of special significance. Literature, both 'elitist' (Kafka; Camus) and 'popular' (Thurow; Grisham) is one of the primary mediums for the critical examination of legal reasoning and the nature and ethics of practice within the wider culture, often revealing subversive and confronting truths normally suppressed by conventional legal education and training. Cinema, along with television, is one of the leading arenas for the formulation of the social consensus concerning the nature of Law and lawyers, often artistically re-staging the processes of legal reasoning and dispute resolution so as to both critique and affirm the legitimacy of legal culture.  This unit will examine all of these issues through a critical analysis and discussion of a number of the seminal 'texts' within both the literature and cinema of Law.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

AI, technology and the law	LAW4542	The different ways in which Artificial Intelligence continues to disrupt both law and the legal profession are well publicised. In this unit, we take a closer look at the legal, ethical and political problems of the day that result from AI. Who wins and who loses in the age of artificial intelligence? The content will change as different problems and attempts at legal solutions arise. This is therefore indicative content: (1) The future of the Legal Profession as it incorporates AI: the extent to which AI will aid or replace some para-legals or even some lawyers; will produce alternatives to dispute resolution though the courts and will address problems of access to justice. For example, there is an algorithm that has allowed users to overturn 160,000 parking tickets is that of the website:�https://www.donotpay.com/.�Richard Susskind (2017) has argued that there will be a completely different model of legal practice arising as a result of AI and his arguments will be analysed. The legal profession will be understood within a broader context by taking a closer look at the regulating of the future of work, including: the threat to the middle classes from a &quot;fourth industrial revolution&quot;; the gig economy; the minimal protection of privacy and surveillance in the workplace. This will include an analysis of the impact of IT on recruitment and promotion. (2) Specific areas of legal changes; (a) Torts Law - For example: changes in civil legal procedure e.g. discovery stage using data mining; privacy issues in common law or statute; regulating the economic use of digital remains: civil regulation of digital afterlife Industry; AI as legal persons. (b) Criminal law: The use of AI to decide where to police, for example this is being used in NSW (see Gifford (2018 below); the impact of algorithms for sentencing and bail decisions and the concerns about racism built into these algorithms, where they have been used in US. (c) Family Law: The use of AI and surveillance as part of domestic abuse. (d) Public law: The implications of AI for democracy; the use of Big data to try to influence the electoral process: the case of Cambridge Analytica; the use of AI in state decision-making such as welfare; state regulation and Tech Giants.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
The death penalty: Law, politics and advocacy	LAW4543	Amnesty International estimates that in 2019, over 650 prisoners were executed worldwide (excludingChina); over 2300 prisoners were sentenced to death and there were roughly 26,600 people on death row.For those who are appealing their sentences, awaiting execution, or seeking clemency, the often-prolongedprocess is a form of punishment in itself, that also gravely affects the lives of family, the local communityand all parties to the proceeding. This unit will examine the existing jurisdictions that apply capital punishment and those jurisdictionsidentified to be at risk of re-introducing capital punishment, to contextualise the death penalty within theinternational law and comparative contexts. Students will gain a solid understanding of the current status of capital punishment on a global front, andhow the practice of the death penalty is framed within international law and human rights standards.Students will examine the impact on the trial of an Accused, when due process safeguards fail, with a focuson police abuse, access to justice, unfair trials, mandatory sentencing and forensic evidence. Students will consider the discriminations faced by those on death row, in terms of class, race, mentalhealth, age, gender, sexuality and other factors and how these factors impact the fair administration ofjustice. Students will explore the advocacy of the abolitionist movement - including the role of publicopinion and deterrence research - and the arguments used by retentionist countries to maintain the statusquo.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Mediation and law: From problem solving to narrative building	LAW4649	The unit explores four models which exist within the field of mediation, and examines their connection with various jurisprudential approaches. Mediation is an alternative method to litigation, in which a third party facilitates negotiation between at least two other parties. Mediation is the paradigmatic alternative to adjudication and its basic principles are unique and different from those of the adversarial model. The course examines the notion of mediation by referring to four conceptual frameworks to understand it: Traditional communal; Pragmatic problem solving; Humanistic Transformative and Narrative Cultural. Each model of mediation will be studied both in practice and theory, and its relation to jurisprudential streams of thought will be examined. Theories such as legal feminism, legal pluralism, multiculturalism and postmodernism will be studied as possible foundations for the various models, and their application will be examined critically through the use of case studies, films and simulations. The overall sequence of the course will show the transformation of mediation from a pragmatic efficient alternative to litigation to a public narrative based method for the resolution of public dispute.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Transnational litigation	LAW4652	This unit compares the private international law of major commercial hubs. Private international law (or conflict of laws) is the body of rules applying to civil disputes with an international element. These are the rules on when a court is to assume jurisdiction, when a foreign judgment is to be recognised, and which law is to be applied to a dispute. Private international law is domestic law. Focusing on commercial disputes, this unit explores aspects of the private international law of Australia, Canada, the European Union, Malaysia, Singapore the UK and the US. The unit analyses and compares the legal rules that may apply at the different stages of an international dispute in each of these systems and on that basis discusses the policy and practical issues involved in each context and the considerations that will become relevant for parties when deciding where to litigate.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Privacy and surveillance in an information age: Comparative law perspectives	LAW4653	This unit will examine, from a comparative perspective, the legal and social issues relating to the protection of individual privacy against the state, the media, companies and other individuals. It will introduce students to comparative perspectives relating to the protection of privacy against intrusions and unauthorised disclosures, and relating to data privacy. In particular, the unit will focus on the challenges posed to privacy by new and emerging technologies. Case studies will be drawn from Australia, the UK, the European Union and the US.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Comparative issues in patent law	LAW4655	This unit will examine from an international and comparative perspective some fundamental questions that arise in patent law:  - Why is a twenty year monopoly in the form of a patent available for inventions? It will critically analyse this question with reference to the origins of patent laws and with reference to the varied past and present rationales that support patent protection; - What subject matter should patent law protect? In particular, it will focus on the challenges posed to patent law by new and emerging technologies in areas such as higher life forms, methods of medical and surgical treatment, business and financial systems and genetic materials; - Why can an inventor choose to keep an invention secret instead of seeking patent protection? We critically evaluate the justifications for inventors to have this choice; and  - What balance should exist between a patentee's exclusive rights and the public domain?  The unit will consider the obligations that relevant international treaties and conventions impose on member states in the design of their patent and trade secrecy laws. Within the context of this international structure, it will immerse students in understanding and critically analysing how Australia and three other jurisdictions (selected from Canada, the United States of America, the European Union, the United Kingdom and New Zealand) approach the above questions. No technical background is required or expected, nor is any previous work in patent law needed.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Game theory and the law	LAW4659	"""Game Theory"" is often considered a subfield within the subject of ""Law and Economics"". This unit is aimed at providing an overview of Law and Economics and then refining that understanding with an expansive examination of Game Theory.  Topics in this unit will include, but are not limited to:   The impact of bicameral v. tricameral systems upon judicial decisions; International agreements' influence upon domestic interpretations of the law; Decisions about specific political candidates and their impact upon macro-understandings within a government party; The role of marginalization upon how and whether issues become considered relevant by judicial and legislative bodies; Statistical data and its use by various parties to push their concerns forward; Trends in voting methods and how those processes encourage deliberation about municipal and state planning in the long term; The relevance of lobbying efforts by private entities and publicly-funded agencies.

Part of the unit will be devoted to the relationship between airlines and passengers. Space law covers the uses of outer space. Students will study the status of this area, the rules for its exploration and exploitation as well as the liability regime covering space activities. Students will also analyse the rules for space applications (satellite telecommunications, satellite TV, earth observation, space flight, military uses).	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Comparative cybercrime	LAW4665	The advent of the internet and the proliferation of information and communication technologies have transformed the way we socialise and do business. However, these technologies may also be used to commit or facilitate the commission of crimes; so-called 'cybercrimes'. The transnational nature of modern communications means that cybercrime is a global problem; with offender and victim potentially located anywhere in the world. Adopting a comparative approach, this unit provides an overview of the challenges of cybercrime, and legal responses to those challenges. Topics to be covered include cybercrime investigations, hacking, identity theft, child exploitation offences, and online harassment. Although drawing primarily upon the experience of common law jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States), these responses will be considered in light of the principal international instrument in the area; the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. There will also be discussion of international efforts to achieve harmonisation of cybercrime laws.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
European human rights law	LAW4666	This unit will provide an overview of the origin, development and current status of human rights protection in Europe. Its primary focus will be on the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which has established the most sophisticated and successful regional system of human rights protection in the world. The European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, holds to account member states for violations of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention to over 800 million persons. The second component concentrates on the European Union and how on the basis of a few EU Treaty provisions - now reinforced by the Charter of Fundamental Rights - the European Court of Justice has fashioned a comprehensive and dynamic system of judicial protection.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Private investment law	LAW4671	This unit discusses the nature and operation of private investment law in Australia. It examines how Australia's legal and taxation systems deal with venture capital and private equity investment. It also examines how the venture capital and private equity industries operate in Australia and in various jurisdictions around the world and how private investments funds are structured. It focuses on the taxation treatment that applies to such investment and discusses relevant capital raising and other regulatory matters, including crowd source funding. It also examines international aspects of private investment law and compares Australia's regulatory and tax rules to those of selected foreign jurisdictions. A range of government tax and other incentives that encourage investors to commit capital to innovative start-up companies are also analysed, along with some incentives that reward these high-growth companies undertake innovative activities such as research and development (R&amp;D).� The following topics will be covered in the unit:  An introduction to the operation and nature of private investment law and how the tax system deals with private investments; The role of start-up companies and venture capital investment in a country's innovation system; Stages of venture capital and private equity investment (i.e., seed, start-up, early expansion, growth, mezzanine, distressed buyouts, etc); Making and exiting investments in start-up and early stage companies (including IPOs, trade sales, management buyouts, leveraged buyouts and share buybacks); The structure and operation of venture capital, private equity, fund of funds and other collective investment vehicles and their treatment under the taxation law; Capital raising issues confronting high-growth start-ups, including crowd funding issues; The role of Australia's employee share scheme regime in supporting innovative start-ups; Government programs aimed at encouraging venture capital and private equity investment in Australia, including the Pooled Development Funds, Venture Capital Limited Partnership, Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnership and Innovation Investment Fund programs; Australia's R&amp;D Tax Incentive program and R&amp;D and commercialisation grant programs; and International programs aimed at stimulating venture capital and private equity investment, and a comparison of these programs with those operating in Australia. 	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
European and international monetary law	LAW4673	This unit will introduce students to European and International Monetary Law. It is divided into three substantive sections: interdisciplinary introduction to money and currencies; international monetary law; and European monetary law.  In the first section, we will explain and discuss the interdisciplinary fundamentals of money and currencies, including the historical background, economic theories and the role of monetary law. The second section will introduce international monetary law, focusing on the work and functions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has played a major role in addressing global financial and sovereign debt crises over the past decades. This section will also introduce and explain the underlying fundamental problems resulting from cross border payment and capital flows, including: convertibility, exchange-rate systems, free movement of capital and international liquidity. The third section will focus on European monetary law, covering the monetary integration process in Europe, and a thorough examination of the constitution and structure of the European Monetary Union (EMU). The unit will conclude with an analysis and critical assessment of the much-debated recent developments within the EMU set in motion by the European sovereign debt crisis, including the implications for countries such as Greece and Germany.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Freedom of speech: Law, theory and policy	LAW4674	This unit covers the law of freedom of expression from a comparative law perspective. Commencing with a discussion of international law on freedom of expression, the course will then move to the emergence and ascendency of the protection of freedom of expression/speech in Europe, under the European Convention on Human Rights, and in the United States, under the First Amendment as well as in other common law jurisdictions. It will also cover significant developments in the permissible limitations on freedom of expression in view of other rights and interests such as property, equality, non-discrimination, public order, national security, privacy and reputation.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International and comparative insolvency law	LAW4675	"This unit will cover the basics of bankruptcy/insolvency law and the general rights of creditors and debtors in various Western nations, i.e. from an international perspective.  The unit will focus on the core aspects of commercial bankruptcy/insolvency statutes in these countries.  It begins with a review of the key insolvency concepts and provisions set forth by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (""UNCITRAL"") with primary emphasis on Part Two of the UNCITRAL Guide On Insolvency Law,  entitled ""core provisions for an effective and efficient insolvency law"", including and highlighting its suggested provisions for reorganizations.  It will then address the insolvency statutes of the United States, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with particular emphasis on chapter 11 reorganizations.  Then the bankruptcy and insolvency laws of various European countries including, but not limited to, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic, again with emphasis on their reorganization provisions, as applicable. Then the course will cover the terms, if any, of the various nations statutes on cross border bankruptcies and the UNCITRAL recommended provisions, together with the resulting problems where there are no or conflicting  statutes  in some countries.  Finally, the course will compare the various statutory provisions in these nations together with their adoption, or not, of the UNCITRAL recommended terms and the effect thereof."	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Judgment and decision-making	LAW4676	"""Judgment and Decision-Making"" explores the principles of human perception, judgment and decision-making that underpin the legal system. Students learn about the heuristics and shortcuts that people use to arrive at judgments and decisions, and the possible biasing effects this has on lawyers, juries, eye-witnesses, and judges. The course challenges students to discover best approaches to advocacy, when voluminous information must be presented to triers of fact. It highlights creative opportunities for evidence, in any matter of law that depends on what members of the relevant population think, believe, or intend to do. Classes are designed to foster high quality discussion and analysis providing an environment conducive to peer interaction and feedback with an emphasis on formative activities."	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International information and media law	LAW4677	Information and media content are potentially ubiquitous, whereas regulation, culture and context are generally not. This makes conflicts between different regulatory schemes inevitable. The conventional legal solutions of resolving jurisdictional conflicts, which have been designed for an offline world, are not sufficient to deal with the problems of the information age. The unit will survey the legal and regulatory approaches currently operating to resolve conflicts in the global exchange of information and media content. The different legal domestic approaches, and their interrelationship with emerging regional governance structures, will be critically examined.  In the first part, the existing concepts of conflicts of law will be analysed and specific approaches (cyber law, setting of international standards, global media governance etc.) will be discussed, including the international institutions (WRC, ITU, ICANN) and dispute resolution fori (WTO, WIPO).  The second part of the unit will explore the human rights context. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and of the media generally, can clash with other human rights such as privacy, data protection, and personality rights. Even though human rights are universal, the way conflicting human rights are balanced will reflect the cultural context and diversity of legal systems.  The third part will shift the focus to the media and information industry. Media content and information must also be seen from a business perspective and, when disseminated across borders, have regard to international business law. Intellectual property and international trade agreements are important levers for the protection of local culture and other domestic interests.  The fourth and final part will deal with information-related crimes, such as copyright violations, propaganda, pornography and child abuse, as well as with information warfare.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International criminal justice	LAW4678	This unit will explore how the international community has responded to the most heinous international crimes, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression in the context of our modern history.

The law of climate change	LAW4679	Climate change is among the most daunting problems the world faces in the 21st century. This unit deals with the legal dimension of climate change, paying due regard to its social, political and economic context. The unit will examine the development of national, supranational and international regulation, and explore how public and private actors mobilise instruments from different fields of law to facilitate or to undermine climate change mitigation and adaptation. This subject examines Australia's response to climate change at national and state levels, and compares to examples in foreign jurisdictions in key regions such as European Union, America, or Asia. Select topical or emerging issues are discussed in detail from areas such as market mechanisms, protection of carbon sinks, clean development, environmental refugees, food security, sustainable development goals etc.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Australian corporations law	LAW4680	The unit critically examines the body of legal rules that govern the formation, management, financing and winding up of Australian corporations. Specific topics include: choice of the corporate business form, formation and characteristics of a corporation, the corporate constitution, corporate finance, share structure and membership, constitution and powers of the corporate organisation (board and general meeting), corporate authority, governance of the corporation, share capital, loan capital and dividends, shareholders' remedies, administration and winding up of the corporation.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Global economic law	LAW4681	The rapidly increasing rate of globalisation of economic activity over the past few decades has dramatically altered the nature and dimensions of global economic transactions and engagement. It has also challenged the capacities of national governments to regulate economic activity within their domestic domains.  The post-World War II trading rules (including GATT), along with the lower cost of international transport and the advent of the internet have facilitated the rapid growth of global economic activity, and the growth of international corporate behemoths. This has brought about substantial economic benefits to many, and assisted with lifting millions of people out of poverty. However, this has come at the expense of lowered competition through the growth of global monopolists (or near monopolists), the exploitation of labour and the environment, and increased tax and regulatory evasion, as national governments struggle to regulate cross-border activities. These trends are placing strains on domestic consensus about the benefits of economic globalisation, which is evident in the rise of nationalistic movements in various countries, including those in developed countries.  This unit engages students in critical discussion and evaluations about the nature and form of these developments, the key global arrangements and institutions involved, the costs and benefits of these developments, and ways in which reforms could be undertaken.  Students will actively engage in analysis and debate about:  - global trading arrangements and institutions (GATT, WTO and free trade agreements);  - global financing arrangements and institutions (IMF, Bank of International Settlements, and the resolution of international investment disputes settlements - the ICSID);  - the possibilities for global regulation of the exploitation of labour and the environment and access to medicines; and  - global policy making institutions and organisations, including the G20, OECD, UNCTAD, UNCITRAL, Davos and NGOs.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Contemporary issues in international sports law	LAW4682	International sport has always been a source of social capital and national pride.  Over the last few decades it also has evolved into a significant commercial industry and vehicle for international diplomacy.  As international sports' social, cultural, economic and political importance has grown and evolved, so too have the points at which it intersects with the law, with the result that legal issues concerning doping and drugs; match fixing and corruption; competition and anti-discrimination; and athlete health, safety and welfare, are as likely to occupy the attention of the world's press as are the achievements of the athletes themselves.      This Unit engages students in critical discussion, analysis and debate about these important contemporary legal issues.  Applying a comparative law perspective - and employing case studies drawn primarily from Australia, Europe and the United States - students will explore how different societies' perception of sport and legal traditions influence the development and application of law to sport.  Students also will examine how international sporting issues expose the limitations of national regulatory regimes, and have led to the creation of transnational regulatory bodies and international dispute resolution mechanisms that themselves have become a source of controversy and scandal - leading to an examination and analysis of these institutions and the manner and extent to which they are held accountable. 	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
EU external relations: Law and policy	LAW4683	The European Union's presence in the world is continuously evolving and expanding. Today, there is virtually no area of international law making where the Union cannot participate - either as an independent international actor or in cooperation with its member states. The EU external actions and the external dimension of its competences have, however, become increasingly complex and contentious. To name but a few of the present challenges:  The refugee crisis and the accession negotiations with Turkey; the Dutch veto to the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement; the negotiation, signature and ratification of CETA and TTIP trade agreements, the incompatibility of intra-EU bilateral investment treaties with EU law; the relations of the EU with the UK post-Brexit or the rejection of the EU's accession treaty to the ECHR by the CJEU. Against this background, the unit will give an overview over the development of the EU's external dimension and its competences in various policy fields. Moreover, it aims to identify future challenges in EU foreign policy making and consider potential solutions.  The first part of the unit will provide an overview of the development, law and politics of the European Union as an international organisation. The students will be introduced to the character, role and function of an international organisation from an international relations perspective. This part will also explain the foundation of the EU's legal order and the relationship between EU and international law.  The second part of the unit will deal with the Union's current role and reach in the international sphere. More specifically, it will consider the (international) legal personality of the Union, the division and nature of the Union's external competences, and its relationship in this sphere vis--vis its member states and third parties. Moreover, the role of the Union's institutions, including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European External Action Services, and the institutional procedures for EU external policy and treaty-making will be discussed and evaluated.   The third part of the unit focuses on the development of the Union's international law making competences in various policy fields, such as trade and investment, Brexit or the Common Foreign and Security Policy) and with various international actors (international and regional organisations as well as third states). The Union's external (trade) relations with Asia and Australia will be discussed in some detail.  The fourth part of the unit will discuss and critically assess some of the aforementioned developments and challenges in the EU's foreign relations law and policy.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

International and transnational law and the green economy	LAW4685	"In a world facing potentially devastating impacts from climate change, such as drought, hunger, population displacement and economic decline, the global community has struggled to find consensus on how to avoid such impacts while continuing to achieve economic development.  The goals of sustainable development and a ""green economy"" require technology innovation and diffusion, especially to developing economies.  However, these goals conflict with the direction of international intellectual property regimes.  The trend in international environment law is towards greater collaboration, sharing of knowledge, transfer of clean technology, whereas the trend in international IP law, especially in the relevant area of patent law, is the opposite - tending towards enhancing IP rights without providing for effective mechanisms to address pressing environmental concerns. International trade agreements, most notably the WTO, have contributed to the increasing divergence of objectives in relation to IP on the one hand and environment on the other  This unit will examine the intersection - conflicts, challenges and opportunities - between international IP, international environmental and international trade laws.  It will identify the points of conflict and incompatibility and will study national, transnational and private initiatives that seek to transcend the challenges and achieve mutual goals."	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Contemporary issues in public policy, regulation and the law	LAW4686	Over the past century, citizens have progressively sought a more civilized and less risky world as well as a stronger economy. As capitalism has deepened, so has regulation grown. Society now appears more concerned than ever about risks, and this leaves governments facing new challenges when making laws and formulating public policies. Many contemporary policy issues exist, such as better regulating finance; ethical food production, enabling a free yet accountable media, controlling 3D printed guns or living with automated road vehicles.  All challenge the modern state and its law.  Students explore how the concept of 'regulation' has expanded beyond the traditional legal notion of rules promulgated by a sovereign state, to include all tools aiming to alter or control the behaviour of people and other entities. Using case studies from the United States, Australia and Europe, a comparative perspective engages students in critical discussion, analysis and debate on contemporary issues. Students examine theories, concepts and constructs in modern liberal capitalist societies. They also acknowledge the limitations of various traditional hard and soft regulatory regimes as we investigate the function of law in pursuing public policy goals.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Human trafficking, modern slavery and the law	LAW4687	This unit examines and evaluates the evolution of the international law response to the global problems of human trafficking and modern slavery. It examines the overlaps between these concepts as well as that of forced labour and servitude.

It considers and evaluates the human rights implications and tensions of these competing 'agendas', including those of criminal justice, gender, human rights, labour, migration, and race.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Comparative commercial transactions law	LAW4688	This unit introduces students to the legal issues relating to transactions undertaken by companies in order to borrow money for their activities. The unit is in two parts. In the first part of the unit, measures of obtaining finance are examined in light of the main principles of the law of secured transactions. The unit undertakes comparisons of jurisdictions and compares the American Uniform Commercial Code and Australian legislation, the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth), to the law in England and in Israel.  The second part of the unit focuses on the law of assignment of debts and raising money through factoring and securitisation.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International humanitarian law	LAW4689	The unit teaches students about the international laws of armed conflict (LOAC), known also as International Humanitarian Law. It will cover the historical development and sources of LOAC, including the permissible methods and means of armed conflict; the protection regime under the Geneva Conventions, their Additional Protocols and the developing body of customary international law; the distinction between combatants and civilians; and enforcement regimes such as that under the International Criminal Court. It will also cover the imbalance of protection between international and non-international armed conflict, and the law of jus ad bellum, that is when war is legal and when it is illegal.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Human rights and migration in comparative perspective	LAW4690	This unit focuses on the human rights dimensions of migration from an international and comparative perspective. The international movement of people poses one of the greatest challenges to the existing regime of international human rights. The unit examines human rights obligations in relation to migration and the obstacles to realising human rights in the context of global mobility. Case law of the Human Rights Committee, the InterAmerican Court and the European Court of Human Rights with regard to migration issues (e.g. family migration, border control) will serve as the starting point. The unit covers legal, theoretical and sociological insights related to migration and human rights. It examines the challenges involved in creating a human rights-based approach within current institutional and national frameworks governing migration.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Comparative election law	LAW4691	The unit will examine the administration and operation of elections in both established and emerging democracies. We will compare and contrast various countries granting of the right to vote, restrictions on that right, design of electoral institutions, regulation of political parties, organization of political campaigns, regulation of campaign finance, and provision of judicial review of election-related issues, among other topics. We will also examine the increasing risk of cyberattacks and other forms of foreign interference in elections. Students should complete the unit with a strong appreciation for the diversity of electoral institutions and arrangements, and informed opinions about potential reform proposals.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Economic, social and cultural rights and international law	LAW4692	This course provides an overview of economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights, both in international human rights law and in a comparative law. It will examine both the theoretical debates raised by the emergence of ESC rights, and the practical issues confronting monitoring bodies and advocates. The course is divided in three parts. First, it will explore the origins of ESC rights and how they have been approached by competing theories about the relationships between the State and the market. Second, it will discuss the status of ESC rights and corresponding State obligations. The right to adequate food shall serve as the main illustration, but other rights, such as the right to education and the right to housing, shall also be discussed. The existence of obligations across boundaries regarding ESC rights (eg duties owed by rich States to the people of poor States) will also be discussed. Third, it will examine the monitoring of ESC rights, both at national level and through regional or international courts of quasi-judicial bodies. Particular attention will be paid to the question of the justiciability of ESC rights, and to the various theories that have been forward to assess the content of the obligation of &quot;progressive realization&quot; of ESC rights, and the role of indicators and benchmarks in such an assessment.	undergraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International human rights law and women	LAW4693	Securing the protection and promotion of the human rights of women remains a challenge in the 21st century. Notwithstanding the significant advances in international human rights norms relating to women, systemic discrimination and inequality are part of everyday life for many women in the world.

There are huge technological, economic, social and environmental changes which will impact the future city. Strategic urban planning (such as Plan Melbourne), and legal framework for implementing that planning policy, is critical to delivering a sustainable, liveable, smart and resilient city. Planning policy creates a vision and direction of what we want the city to be, but that vision and directions are often contested, and the implementation of policy must consider a huge range of issues, interests and stakeholders. Important issues such as urban congestion, urban density, transport infrastructure, provision of services (energy, water, telecommunications), housing availability, housing affordability, the location and changing nature of work, urban sprawl, loss of agricultural land and biodiversity, land use change and remediation for former industrial land, protecting cultural heritage, mitigating and adapting to climate change, controlling pollution, waste management and resource recovery, regional and inter-city connections. All of these issues (and more) are played out daily in the planning and environment legal framework. This unit will focus on how Victorian planning and environment legislation, key institutions, decision-makers and forums for dispute resolution and inquiry, address these complex and challenging issues. The unit will focus on the legal framework for urban planning, development approval, impact assessment, facilitating major projects (including major transport, energy, waste and land use change projects); the role of key decision makers in Victoria including the planning and environment ministers, councils, referral authorities and other government agencies, and forums for dispute resolution and inquiry including the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, Planning Panels and Advisory Committees.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International environmental law	LAW5314	This unit examines the way in which the international community tackles existing and future environmental problems (broadly defined), including new technologies and climate change, as well as hazardous waste disposal, animal welfare, etc. International obligations and Australian domestic obligations in respect of these various environmental issues will be examined, as will the way in which these obligations subsequently penetrate into the national legal order. An important feature of the unit is to break down the partition between international environmental law and other areas of the law. For instance international climate change law does not operate in insulation from banking and finance; International biodiversity and animal welfare issues have to operate alongside international trade law; The health, environmental and human rights obligations of companies in a corporate social responsibility (CSR) context require insight into transnational litigation, including conflict of laws.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Protecting commercial innovation: Patents and trade secrets	LAW5321	This is an important unit for any student who practises or seeks to practise in the area of intellectual property law or who works in an innovative commercial environment where research results in new products and processes. A patent provides the patentee with a critical and powerful tool for commercial exploitation of new inventions in all fields of technology. Invention is necessarily exciting and dynamic and leads to cutting edge innovation in such areas as biotechnology, nanotechnology, medical and therapeutic devices and treatments, business methods and systems and internet related inventions. The grant of patent monopoly rights provides the owner with a powerful tool that directly impacts on competition. A patent can have significant implications for users and the public in general who seek access to new technology on reasonable terms. An essential feature of the patent system is the public disclosure of the invention in return for the patent monopoly but the use of that information is restrained by the scope of the patentee's exclusive rights. The equitable doctrine of breach of confidence provides an alternative form of protection for inventions where secrecy is maintained. This unit teaches the fundamental principles of patent law and the laws that protect trade secrets in an interactive manner and with recourse to both legal and practical materials that aid understanding and appreciation of the underlying concepts and policy issues.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Second, it will discuss the status of ESC rights and corresponding State obligations. The right to adequate food shall serve as the main illustration, but other rights, such as the right to education and the right to housing, shall also be discussed. The existence of obligations across boundaries regarding ESC rights (eg duties owed by rich States to the people of poor States) will also be discussed. Third, it will examine the monitoring of ESC rights, both at national level and through regional or international courts of quasi-judicial bodies. Particular attention will be paid to the question of the justiciability of ESC rights, and to the various theories that have been forward to assess the content of the obligation of ""progressive realization"" of ESC rights, and the role of indicators and benchmarks in such an assessment."	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Terrorism and human rights	LAW5365	"There has been an intense preoccupation with the need to combat global terrorism since the attacks on the United States in 2001 and the subsequent 'war on terror'. This campaign is multi-faceted and includes police actions, military campaigns and the enactment of harsh anti-terrorism legislation across the world, including Australia, the US and the UK. Global measures have been taken by the United Nation, particularly the UN Security Council. These domestic and international laws, measures and policies have had profound impacts on the enjoyment of human rights, including ramifications for rights such as the right to be free from arbitrary detention, the right to privacy, the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom from torture, and the right to life. Of course, the relevant laws and policies are often justified on the basis of the protection of human rights, such as one's right to be protected from terrorists. The appropriate balance between human rights and liberty on the one hand, and national security and protection from terrorism on the other, is therefore a focus of this course. The compatibility of those aspects of the"" war"" on terror involving armed conflict with international humanitarian law (the law of armed conflict) is also analysed."	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Energy law, regulation and policy	LAW5367	Since the oil shocks of the 1970s, Australian, regional and international energy markets have experienced significant economic and structural transformations. These changes have been accompanied by considerable legal and policy developments, reflecting escalating global energy demand, growing worldwide concerns over diminishing global supplies of traditional fossil fuel resources, cost and price fluctuations, security of energy supply and demand, environmental hazards of fossil fuel production and consumption (e.g., climate change, atmospheric, soil and water pollution and harm) and a variety of human rights matters issues (e.g., corporate responsibility and indigenous peoples' rights regarding natural resources). By way of background, this unit canvasses a broad range of domestic and international energy markets, the global importance of energy, key multidisciplinary aspects of energy markets such as price, cost, security of supply, environmental damage, and international and internal armed conflict.  At the domestic level, this historical development of the national energy market (electricity and gas) and the policy decision making, governance arrangements and legislative and regulatory framework of the nascent Australian Energy Market.  Various Australian energy sectors - electricity and gas - are examined in terms of relevant sources of energy law, constitutional constraints, governance and regulatory functions of key market institutions, together with legal obligations, responsibilities and/or participatory rights and benefits of key stakeholders in the Australian Energy Market (e.g., pipeline access arrangements, consumer protections).  Against the many benefits of energy, the adverse environmental and social impacts of traditional energy production and consumption on the environment, in particular greenhouse gas emissions, are considered.  Examples of domestic, supranational and international legislative, regulatory and policy responses to dealing with environmental harm - emissions trading, carbon taxes, fuel mix changes towards renewable energies and/or nuclear power are considered to illustrate these contemporary issues.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Principles of government law and administration	LAW5434	Government is much more than law. This unit examines the legal, policy and ethical issues affecting government at the federal, state and local council levels. This course will enable students and practicing officials to understand how governments and their administrative processes are structured, how the legal operation of government is affected by Westminster principles, oversight bodies and public sector ethics and how government is changing.  The first part of the course will focus on understanding the legal framework of government, with particular attention to parliamentary and ministerial oversight of government decision making. This part of the unit will build upon and advance the knowledge of students who have studied administrative law. For those who have not, it will provide a legal and theoretical framework to locate and strengthen their professional knowledge. One theme of this part of the course is the difference between law and politics. How independent can and should government officials be from politicians? How can government officials balance the often competing requirements of legal and political accountability? When and how can politicians properly direct or influence government officials, particularly those appointed to independent positions? Another theme of this part of the course is the requirements of sound decision making.  What makes a sound decision? What are best practice models of decision making? How can reasons for decisions be drafted and defended?  The second part of this course will address the avenues of accountability and oversight outside the courts. Attention will be given to modern theories suggesting that there is now a 'fourth' arm of government, which takes in the so-called integrity bodies such as Ombudsmen, Auditors-General and anti-corruption agencies.   The third part of this course will examine public sector ethics - the guiding principles to which all public officials are subject. Consideration will be given to the separate and complimentary function of public sector values. What are the special ethical rules and values of the public sector? How much of these values are formal or written? How do we manage conflicts between normal workplace pressures and the unique problems of government such as political pressure? This part of the course will draw heavily on the experience of students and guest speakers for discussion and problem solving.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Principles of succession law	LAW5450	"Around 30-40,000 people die each year in Victoria. The management and distribution of their property is determined by principles of succession law.  Succession law governs how the property of a deceased is distributed, who can manage a deceased estate and how distributions may be challenged distribution. This unit will enable students to understand the key issues affecting succession law, the directions that people can incorporate into a will and the professional obligations lawyers face in succession law. The unit covers four key elements of succession law. The first is intestacy (when a person dies without a valid will) and will making. This part of the course examines the presumptive distribution of assets in intestacy and the novel Victorian approach. It also examines the execution requirements for will making and the process to grant probate to wills and codicils that do not meet those requirements. The second key issue of the course is the doctrines affecting testamentary gifts. What can and cannot be done through the gift clauses? This part of the course examines the nature and  limits of ""testamentary freedom"" (the ability of people to dispose of their estate as they wish).A key such limit is ""family provision"", under which close relative and partners of a deceased person can challenge the distribution of an estate. The third part of the course examines managing and distributing deceased estates.  This includes the standards for those managing an estate, control of funeral and burial arrangements and when and how can beneficiaries challenge or remove a personal representative. The final part of the course examines professional obligations of lawyers.  Succession law generates a high level of professional complaints against lawyers.  The course will examine the special rules governing the conduct of lawyers, particularly when they act the personal representative of an estate."	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Comparative issues in patent law	LAW5611	This unit will examine from an international and comparative perspective some fundamental questions that arise in patent law:  - Why is a twenty year monopoly in the form of a patent available for inventions? We will critically analyse this question with reference to the origins of patent laws and with reference to the varied past and present rationales that support patent protection; - What subject matter should patent law protect? In particular, it will focus on the challenges posed to patent law by new and emerging technologies in areas such as higher life forms, methods of medical and surgical treatment, business and financial systems and genetic materials; - Why can an inventor choose to keep an invention secret instead of seeking patent protection? We critically evaluate the justifications for inventors to have this choice; and  - What balance should exist between a patentee's exclusive rights and the public domain?  The unit will consider the obligations that relevant international treaties and conventions impose on member states in the design of their patent laws. Within the context of this international structure, it will immerse students in understanding and critically analysing how Australia and three other jurisdictions (selected from Canada, the United States of America, the European Union, the United Kingdom and New Zealand) approach the above questions.

Mediation and law: From problem solving to narrative building	LAW5621	The unit explores four models which exist within the field of mediation, and examines their connection with various jurisprudential approaches. Mediation is an alternative method to litigation, in which a third party facilitates negotiation between at least two other parties. Mediation is the paradigmatic alternative to adjudication and its basic principles are unique and different from those of the adversarial model. The course examines the notion of mediation  by referring to four conceptual frameworks to understand it: Traditional communal; Pragmatic problem solving; Humanistic Transformative and Narrative Cultural. Each model of mediation will be studied both in practice and theory, and its relation to jurisprudential streams of thought will be examined. Theories such as legal feminism, legal pluralism, multiculturalism and postmodernism  will be studied as possible foundations for the various models, and their application will be examined critically through the use of case studies, films and simulations. The overall sequence of the course will show the transformation of mediation from a pragmatic efficient alternative to litigation to a public narrative based method for the resolution of public dispute.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Introduction to Islamic law	LAW5624	In its first part, the unit will consider the nature, characteristics and objectives of Islamic Law and contrast them with other legal systems. In its second part, the unit will explore the historic development of Islamic Law from the time of the Prophet to the era of the Fiqh (Golden Era), as well as its current significance. In the third part of the unit, various branches of Islamic Law are considered in more detail. The focus is on Islamic family law, Islamic banking and takaful, and Islamic criminal law.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International and comparative insolvency law	LAW5626	"This course will cover the basics of bankruptcy/insolvency law and the general rights of creditors and debtors in various Western nations, i.e. from an international perspective.  The course will focus on the core aspects of commercial bankruptcy/insolvency statutes in these countries.  It begins with a review of the key insolvency concepts and provisions set forth by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (""UNCITRAL"") with primary emphasis on Part Two of the UNCITRAL Guide On Insolvency Law,  entitled ""core provisions for an effective and efficient insolvency law"", including and highlighting its suggested provisions for reorganizations.  It will then address the insolvency statutes of the US and selected European regimes.  Finally, the course will compare the various statutory provisions in these nations together with their adoption, or not, of the UNCITRAL recommended terms and the effect thereof."	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Judgment and decision-making	LAW5627	"""Judgment and Decision-Making"" explores the principles of human perception, judgment and decision-making that underpin the legal system. Students will learn about the heuristics and shortcuts that people use to arrive at judgments and decisions, and the possible biasing effects on lawyers, juries, eye-witnesses, and judges. The course challenges students to discover best approaches to advocacy, when voluminous information must be presented to triers of fact. It highlights creative opportunities for evidence, in any matter of law that depends on what members of the relevant population think, believe, or intend to do. Classes are designed to foster high quality discussion and analysis providing an environment conducive to peer interaction and feedback with an emphasis on formative activities."	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International and comparative trademark law	LAW5628	This unit will provide an overview of the obligations under international law to provide protection to trade marks and a comparison of selected, key aspects of trade mark protection in Australia, the United States and the EU. Consequently, in relation to international law, it will examine the trade mark aspects of the TRIPS agreement (including consideration of geographical indications) and the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy of ICANN relating to domain names. To a lesser extent, the unit will deal with the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Madrid Protocol relating to multiple filings of trade mark applications. Selected, key aspects of comparison will include issues such as jurisdiction specific approaches to ownership, the requirements for registrability of trade marks such as shape trade marks and the different approaches to infringement, including dilution of trade marks and parallel importing. Other topics may include the registration and control of domain names. It is likely that, in light of Australian legislation and WTO challenges, the unit will also critically examine the arguments of the tobacco industry that international trade mark obligations prevent the implementation of plain packaging of cigarettes.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
European and international monetary law	LAW5630	This unit is divided into three main sections: interdisciplinary introduction to money and currencies; international monetary law; and European monetary law. The first section will explain the interdisciplinary fundamentals of money and currencies, including the historical background, economic theories and the role of law. The second section will introduce international monetary law, focusing on the work and functions of the IMF, which has played an increasingly major role in addressing global financial and sovereign debt crises. The third section will cover the monetary integration process in Europe, and a thorough examination of the European Monetary Union (EMU). The unit will conclude with a critical assessment of the much-debated recent developments within the EMU set in motion by the European sovereign debt crisis, including the implications for countries such as Greece and Germany.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Lawyers, literature and cinema	LAW5631	The representation of Law and lawyers within popular culture is one of the most important, but underappreciated, dimensions of the legal profession, of practice, and of the practical negotiation of legal ethics. The 'social status' of the lawyer within the wider culture is one of the dominant factors governing the student's decision to enter (or not to enter) law school. Furthermore, the dissemination of judicial procedure and dispute resolution through popular culture and the mass media is one of the primary means of both enforcing and challenging the legitimacy of Law and its practitioners within the broader community.  Within the diverse representations of Law offered by popular culture both literature and cinema are of special significance. Literature, both 'elitist' (Kafka; Camus) and 'popular' (Thurow; Grisham) is one of the primary mediums for the critical examination of legal reasoning and the nature and ethics of practice within the wider culture, often revealing subversive and confronting truths normally suppressed by conventional legal education and training. Cinema, along with television, is one of the leading arenas for the formulation of the social consensus concerning the nature of Law and lawyers, often artistically re-staging the processes of legal reasoning and dispute resolution so as to both critique and affirm the legitimacy of legal culture.  This unit will examine all of these issues through a critical analysis and discussion of a number of the seminal 'texts' within both the literature and cinema of Law.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
International information and media law	LAW5632	Information and media content are potentially ubiquitous, whereas regulation, culture and context are generally not. This makes conflicts between different regulatory schemes inevitable. The conventional legal solutions of resolving jurisdictional conflicts, which have been designed for an offline world, are not sufficient to deal with the problems of the information age. The unit will survey the legal and regulatory approaches currently operating to resolve conflicts in the global exchange of information and media content. The different legal domestic approaches, and their interrelationship with emerging regional governance structures, will be critically examined.  In the first part, the existing concepts of conflicts of law will be analysed and specific approaches (cyber law, setting of international standards, global media governance etc.) will be discussed, including the international institutions (WRC, ITU, ICANN) and dispute resolution fori (WTO, WIPO).  The second part of the unit will explore the human rights context. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and of the media generally, can clash with other human rights such as privacy, data protection, and personality rights. Even though human rights are universal, the way conflicting human rights are balanced will reflect the cultural context and diversity of legal systems.  The third part will shift the focus to the media and information industry. Media content and information must also be seen from a business perspective and, when disseminated across borders, have regard to international business law. Intellectual property and international trade agreements are important levers for the protection of local culture and other domestic interests.  The fourth and final part will deal with information-related crimes, such as copyright violations, propaganda, pornography and child abuse, as well as with information warfare.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Contemporary workplace relations law	LAW5633	This unit will examine the following major areas: 1. the development of systems for regulating dispute settlement and determining conditions of employment, including the Australian federal system for regulating workplace relations, industrial disputes and minimum conditions of employment, the systems in North America, United Kingdom and Europe; 2. the impact of globalization and international labour standards through international labour organization conventions and its regulation; 3. the scope and coverage of domestic legislation, including the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and its constitutional basis and the degree of legislative intervention in comparator countries of Australia, United States, Canada, and Europe; 4. sources of minimum conditions , minimum wages and the safety nets; 5. the purpose, scope and content of collective and enterprise agreements; good faith bargaining and the use of industrial action as a bargaining tool; 6. the protection of workplace rights, such as the right to join a union in the comparator countries; and 7. approaches to the enforcement of minimum conditions, modern awards and enterprise agreements, in Australia through the Fair Work Ombudsman and the court system and in the comparator countries.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Global economic law	LAW5634	The rapidly increasing rate of globalisation of economic activity over the past few decades has dramatically altered the nature and dimensions of global economic transactions and engagement. It has also challenged the capacities of national governments to regulate economic activity within their domestic domains.  The post-World War II trading rules (including GATT), along with the lower cost of international transport and the advent of the internet have facilitated the rapid growth of global economic activity, and the growth of international corporate behemoths. This has brought about substantial economic benefits to many, and assisted with lifting millions of people out of poverty. However, this has come at the expense of lowered competition through the growth of global monopolists (or near monopolists), the exploitation of labour and the environment, and increased tax and regulatory evasion, as national governments struggle to regulate cross-border activities. These trends are placing strains on domestic consensus about the benefits of economic globalisation, which is evident in the rise of nationalistic movements in various countries, including those in developed countries.  This unit engages students in critical discussion and evaluations about the nature and form of these developments, the key global arrangements and institutions involved, the costs and benefits of these developments, and ways in which reforms could be undertaken.  Students will actively engage in analysis and debate about:  1. global trading arrangements and institutions (GATT, WTO and free trade agreements);  2. global financing arrangements and institutions (IMF, Bank of International Settlements, and the resolution of international investment disputes settlements - the ICSID);  3. the possibilities for global regulation of the exploitation of labour and the environment and access to medicines; and  4. global policy making institutions and organisations, including the G20, OECD, UNCTAD, UNCITRAL, Davos and NGOs.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Contemporary issues in international sports law	LAW5635	International sport has always been a source of social capital and national pride.  Over the last few decades it also has evolved into a significant commercial industry and vehicle for international diplomacy.  As international sports' social, cultural, economic and political importance has grown and evolved, so too have the points at which it intersects with the law, with the result that legal issues concerning doping and drugs; match fixing and corruption; competition and anti-discrimination; and athlete health, safety and welfare, are as likely to occupy the attention of the world's press as are the achievements of the athletes themselves.      This Unit engages students in critical discussion, analysis and debate about these important contemporary legal issues.  Applying a comparative law perspective - and employing case studies drawn primarily from Australia, Europe and the United States - students will explore how different societies' perception of sport and legal traditions influence the development and application of law to sport.  Students also will examine how international sporting issues expose the limitations of national regulatory regimes, and have led to the creation of transnational regulatory bodies and international dispute resolution mechanisms that themselves have become a source of controversy and scandal - leading to an examination and analysis of these institutions and the manner and extent to which they are held accountable.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
EU external relations: Law and policy	LAW5636	The unit will examine the European Union's external dimension and its competences in various policy fields. The first part of the unit will provide an overview of the development, law and politics of the EU as an international organisation. The second part will consider the EU's current role and reach in the international sphere, in particular its (international) legal personality of the Union, the division and nature of the Union's external competences, and its relationship in this sphere vis--vis its member states and third parties. The third part focuses on the EU's international law making competences in various policy fields, such as trade and investment, with a particular focus on Asia and Australia; and the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In its final part, the unit will critically assess some of the challenges for the future development of the EU's foreign relations law and policy.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Asian legal systems	LAW5637	This unit is designed to examine contemporary issues in the Asian legal systems. It will examine the Asian perspectives on the rule of law, the court reform, constitutionalism, security and human rights, legal pluralism, corruption and the issue of law and development. Students in this subject will gain a comparative overview of the legal systems of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, with reference to other Asian countries as appropriate.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Climate change and international law	LAW5638	Climate change has been described as the defining legal and policy challenge of the 21st century. This unit provides an introduction to the international legal response to this challenge. It examines critically the emergence of climate change as a public policy problem, the relationship between climate science and climate policy, and the negotiation, content and implementation of international legal instruments related to climate change. It will not consider national, sub national or non-governmental approaches to climate change. Topics to be addressed include:  the causes and impacts of, and trends in, global climate change; the problem of scientific uncertainty and its implications for international climate change law; the main options for and obstacles to mitigation of and adaptation to climate change, and the relationship between mitigation and adaptation; the international politics of climate change, including the differing positions, interests and priorities of developed and developing states and the special challenges facing particularly vulnerable states and communities; the negotiation, content and implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, including Joint Implementation, the Clean Development Mechanism, international emissions trading, financial assistance and technology transfer; key issues and developments in the negotiation and implementation of a post-Kyoto international climate change agreement; the role and meaning of the concepts of state sovereignty, common concern of humankind, sustainable development, common but differentiated responsibilities, intra- and inter-generational equity, the precautionary principle, and climate justice in the international climate change legal regime; key issues, options, proposals and rules surrounding the incorporation of land use and forestry into the international climate change regime, including Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD); compliance, enforcement and dispute settlement in the international climate change regime; interactions between the international climate change regime and international regimes related to ozone depletion, biodiversity, law of the sea, human rights, and international trade; and options and prospects for a transition to a carbon-free or low-carbon future. 	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

International and transnational law and the green economy	LAW5640	"In a world facing potentially devastating impacts from climate change, such as drought, hunger, population displacement and economic decline, the global community has struggled to find consensus on how to avoid such impacts while continuing to achieve economic development. The goals of sustainable development and a ""green economy"" require technology innovation and diffusion, especially to developing economies.  However, these goals conflict with the direction of international intellectual property regimes.  The trend in international environment law is towards greater collaboration, sharing of knowledge, transfer of clean technology, whereas the trend in international IP law, especially in the relevant area of patent law, is the opposite - tending towards enhancing IP rights without providing for effective mechanisms to address pressing environmental concerns. International trade agreements, most notably the WTO, have contributed to the increasing divergence of objectives in relation to IP on the one hand and environment on the other  This unit will examine the intersection - conflicts, challenges and opportunities - between international IP, international environmental and international trade laws.  It will identify the points of conflict and incompatibility and will study national, transnational and private initiatives that seek to transcend the challenges and achieve mutual goals."	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
The global lawyer	LAW5642	This unit focuses on building professional capacity to engage in international, supranational, and transnational legal practice. It seeks to make students aware of the opportunities as the role of traditional lawyering is broadened, as well as the ethical concerns and responsibilities of being a global, digital lawyer. It introduces the fundamentals of global legal systems and develops the skills to embark upon legal practice across different cultures and systems, including interacting ethically with clients and lawyers from diverse jurisdictions. International management and firm operation will be dealt with as students are challenged with the problem of how to maintain local identity while providing international service. The unit also equips students to harness digital technologies in the globalisation of legal practice, and to deal with the challenges they pose to the traditional understanding of key legal concepts and to the lawyer's professional identity. Issues such as the changing use of digital technology, modern understandings of privacy and control over information, copyright and ownership of data, and issues of data retention, data security, legal informatics and legal professional ethics will be considered.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Sovereignty and globalisation	LAW5644	This unit will examine the relationship between sovereignty and globalisation from the 'discovery' of the Americas, to the emergence of the nation-state and popular sovereignty, through colonisation and de-colonisation, to present concerns with financial and technological integration and the 'war on terror'. It will ask what it means to be 'sovereign' in a globalised world and how this question shapes and is shaped by the allocation of legal, political and economic power in the world.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Contemporary issues in public policy, regulation and the law	LAW5647	Over the past century, citizens have progressively sought a more civilized and less risky world as well as a stronger economy. As capitalism has deepened, so has regulation grown. Society now appears more concerned than ever about risks, and this leaves governments facing new challenges when making laws and formulating public policies. Many contemporary policy issues exist, such as better regulating finance; ethical food production, enabling a free yet accountable media, controlling 3D printed guns or living with automated road vehicles.  All challenge the modern state and its law.  Students explore how the concept of 'regulation' has expanded beyond the traditional legal notion of rules promulgated by a sovereign state, to include all tools aiming to alter or control the behaviour of people and other entities. Using case studies from the United States, Australia and Europe, a comparative perspective engages students in critical discussion, analysis and debate on contemporary issues. Students examine theories, concepts and constructs in modern liberal capitalist societies. They also acknowledge the limitations of various traditional hard and soft regulatory regimes as we investigate the function of law in pursuing public policy goals.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Comparative commercial transactions law	LAW5648	This unit introduces students to the legal issues relating to transactions undertaken by companies in order to borrow money for their activities. The unit is in two parts. In the first part of the unit, measures of obtaining finance are examined in light of the main principles of the law of secured transactions. The unit undertakes comparisons of jurisdictions and compares the American Uniform Commercial Code and Australian legislation, the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth), to the law in England and in Israel.  The second part of the unit focuses on the law of assignment of debts and raising money through factoring and securitisation.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Law in the age of artificial intelligence	LAW5649	The different ways in which Artificial Intelligence continues to disrupt both law and the legal profession are well publicised. In this unit, we take a closer look at the legal, ethical and political problems of the day that result from AI. Who wins and who loses in the age of artificial intelligence? The content will change as different problems and attempts at legal solutions arise. This is therefore indicative content: (1) The future of the Legal Profession as it incorporates AI: the extent to which AI will aid or replace some para-legals or even some lawyers; will produce alternatives to dispute resolution though the courts and will address problems of access to justice. For example, there is an algorithm that has allowed users to overturn 160,000 parking tickets is that of the website: https://www.donotpay.com/. Richard Susskind (2017) has argued that there will be a completely different model of legal practice arising as a result of AI and his arguments will be analysed. The legal profession will be understood within a broader context by taking a closer look at the regulating of the future of work, including: the threat to the middle classes from a &quot;fourth industrial revolution&quot;; the gig economy; the minimal protection of privacy and surveillance in the workplace. This will include an analysis of the impact of IT on recruitment and promotion. (2) Specific areas of legal changes; (a) Torts Law - For example: changes in civil legal procedure e.g. discovery stage using data mining; privacy issues in common law or statute; regulating the economic use of digital remains: civil regulation of digital afterlife Industry; AI as legal persons. (b) Criminal law: The use of AI to decide where to police, for example this is being used in NSW (see Gifford (2018 below); the impact of algorithms for sentencing and bail decisions and the concerns about racism built into these algorithms, where they have been used in US. (c) Family Law: The use of AI and surveillance as part of domestic abuse. (d) Public law: The implications of AI for democracy; the use of Big data to try to influence the electoral process: the case of Cambridge Analytica; the use of AI in state decision-making such as welfare; state regulation and Tech Giants.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law

Cybercrime	LAW5805	This unit provides an overview of the legal issues which arise when electronic and telecommunication devices are used in the commission or� facilitation of crime. Such devices allow offences to be committed on an unparalleled scale, sometimes with international ramifications, yet with greatly reduced chance of detection. They therefore present a significant challenge to investigative agencies and to conventional notions of crime and jurisdiction. Topics to be covered include the nature of cybercrime, detection and investigation, application of existing criminal law principles, legislative responses, and jurisdictional issues.	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
Technology, justice and human rights	LAW5806	This unit will examine how existing and future technologies (data, machine learning, AI and surveillance) impact the human rights of individuals, with particular emphasis on freedom of expression and association and freedom from discrimination. It will then turn to examine the ways in which a human rights framework may be applied to the regulation of these technologies. It will compare and contrast the various human rights law protections which may be implemented in order to maximise the social benefits and minimise the risks, associated with these new technologies. In particular, it will analyse the existing institutional and domestic architecture on human rights and discuss ways in which these can be utilized to provide scrutiny and oversight of technological developments. This will include a deep analysis of treaty law and statements of UN Human Rights Committee and Special Rapporteurs which are relevant to technology. At the domestic level, it will examine and compare and contrast the way in which existing human rights oversight mechanisms have dealt with technology in Australia (such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the various State and Territory human rights charter regimes). It will also look to the future to assess the law reform proposals for ensuring the human rights compliance of technologies, including policy recommendations made by Australian bodies (eg the Australian Human Rights Commissions Inquiry on Human Rights and Technology) and international and domestic civil society organisations (Amnesty International, Digital Rights Watch etc). Students will asked to deconstruct and question these reform proposals and exercise legal creativity by formulating reform proposals of their own as part of the assessment. �	postgraduate	Faculty of Law	Faculty of Law
